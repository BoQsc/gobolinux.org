2 Characteristics of the current hierarchy
<BR>
</H1>

<P>
In the UNIX tree, directories serve two purposes: differentiate categories
of files and differentiate their location in the network. Files of
the ``executable'' category from all applications are stored in
six directories: <TT>/bin</TT>, <TT>/usr/bin</TT>, <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>,
<TT>/sbin</TT>, <TT>/usr/sbin</TT> and <TT>/usr/local/sbin<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot255"><SUP>2</SUP></A></TT>, where the criteria of choice to determine which of those six directories
is used for a given file is basically its physical location (local
or remote). Still, some programs are installed in other locations
than those dictated by the above rules. For instance, the File System
Hierarchy standard has an arbitrary list of which executable files
should be stored at the <TT>/bin</TT> directory.

<P>
Some programs assume that certain files are stored in specific locations
(for example, <TT>/lib/cpp</TT>, <TT>/usr/bin/python</TT>). This is
a source of incompatibilities, even between different Linux distributions
that follow the traditional model of directories. But the biggest
problem caused by this approach is the difficulty in the removal of
programs, since files of different applications are mixed in the same
directories and different files from a single application are spread
throughout a number of directories.

<P>
The solution used by companies and organizations that develop Linux
distributions in order to maintain a correspondence between individual
files and applications is <I>``package managing''</I>, that is,
installing and removing software using a program that maintains a
database that relates existing files in the system to the applications
from which they were originated. The main limitation of this method
is the fact that installation of applications from source code generates
inconsistencies in the database.

<P>
A common practice is to keep the <TT>/usr</TT> hierarchy maintained
by the package manager and target the installation of programs compiled
locally to <TT>/usr/local</TT>. This keeps the database consistent,
but does not solve the issue on how to remove programs installed from
source.

<P>
The UNIX hierarchy standard defined an extra directory, <TT>/opt</TT>,
to allow groups of applications to be installed separately from the
rest. This can be considered an acknowledgment of the existence of
the problems enumerated above. Further, this causes a conflict of
criteria in the standard itself.
