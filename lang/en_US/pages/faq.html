<h1>The GoboLinux FAQ</h1>

<h3>What the heck is GoboLinux?</h3>

<p>
GoboLinux is a Linux distribution that features a new filesystem
organization, which departs from the traditional Unix heritage of Linux
systems. Basically, this means that it is not based in directories such as
/usr and /etc. The main idea of the alternative hierarchy is to
store all files belonging to an application in its own separate subtree;
therefore we have directories such as /Programs/FooPlayer/2.0/lib.
</p>
<p>
To allow the system to find these files, they are logically grouped in
directories such as /System/Index/bin, which, you guessed it,
indexes all executable files inside the Programs hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
To maintain backwards compatibility with traditional Unix/Linux apps,
there are symbolic links that mimic the Unix tree, such as "/usr/bin ->
/System/Index/bin", and "/sbin -> /System/Index/bin"
(this example shows that arbitrary differentiations between files of the
same category were also removed).
</p>
<p>
<a href="?page=at_a_glance">Here is a more visual overview</a>.
</p>

<h3>Did you redesign the tree to make it more newbie-friendly?</h3>

<p>
No. In fact, it was motivated to fulfill the needs of users who
prefer to install applications from the original source packages instead
of relying on the distribution. That is the main reason
why each application gets its own directory: so you can install it from
source there and then remove it with an "rm -rf". So, you see, GoboLinux
was designed focusing the experienced user who doesn't like things to be
automagical. Our scripts merely automate procedures, but they don't
"make decisions", and whenever they have to, they ask first.
</p>
<p>
The binary package collection was created as a way to avoid duplication
of effort between users. The Compile project was created to store
"compilation rules" of the original source packages of the applications,
given that there is no single standard on how to compile apps on Linux.
We do not wish to estabilish a "packaging standard" such as RPM. We
think that there is no real need for "packages" if the original .tar.gz
is properly made. For instance, when an application uses the GNU
AutoTools (autoconf, automake...), compiling for GoboLinux is trivial;
for non-trivial cases, Compile takes care of accumulating the necessary
knowledge on how to compile things.
</p>
<p>
However, given the more logical directory tree, GoboLinux is often
considered a more conceptually friendly distribution, as its structure
is more logical and less hindered by historical limitations. But we do
not target beginners as a specific goal (at least not in short or mid term).
</p>

<h3>Is GoboLinux "ready"?</h3>

<p>
Yes, it is ready in the sense that you can, today, have a full operating
system running 100% on GoboLinux, like many people around the world do.
</p>

<h3>What is its current status?</h3>

<p>
This can be split in two questions, one about the status of the
GoboLinux tools, and one about the availability of packages.
</p>
<p>
GoboLinux relies on a series of tools that automate various tasks, such
as generation, installation and removal of packages, and most
importantly, maintainance of the symbolic links that keep the system
consistent. These tools are fairly stable, as they are a few years old
by now.
</p>
<p>
Another important issue when using a distribution is the availability of
packages, ie, software that you can download in binary form and install
in it straight away. In this aspect, GoboLinux still lags
behind other estabilished distributions, as we don't have a large community
of developers and we are not based on another distribution as many
distros are, so we don't have another pool of packages to base ourselves from.
We have, however, all packages needed to get a running system (all
packages that are part of "Linux From Scratch" and "Beyond Linux From
Scratch" projects, for example), plus many others, such as KDE and all
related packages, and the list <a href="?page=packages">just won't stop growing</a>.
Also, we have an even larger set of <a href="?page=recipes">compilation recipes</a>
for use with the <a href="?page=compile">GoboLinux Compile</a> tool, which allows
one to create packages from source.
</p>

<h3>Who created GoboLinux? What are its origins?</h3>

<p>
The concept was created by Hisham Muhammad.
The first version of GoboLinux was created by Hisham and 
André Detsch.
</p>
<p>
GoboLinux has matured over a period of two years. Initially it started
as a way to install programs cleanly inside a regular user account at
the University (since we didn't have the real Linux tree available anyway,
it was an opportunity to redesign the tree).
</p>
<p>
One day, after The Great Filesystem Crash in Hisham's computer,
he had to reinstall the whole system. That's when the idea came to
use, in the new system, only the alternative tree (which in the
pre-crash system, already held about 80% of all installed software).
André was also considering reinstalling his Linux system, so they
gathered one weekend at his house, and ran the entire Linux From
Scratch procedure, changing it to use the alternative
directory tree. The result was jokingly named GoboLinux, and as 
it usually happens, the name stuck.
</p>

<h3>Who develops GoboLinux?</h3>

<p>
From its inception (described in the previous answer) on, we started
getting more and more users, many of which, in the true spirit
of Free Software, also became contributors the project. As in every
project, people come and go, so it's impossible to list all names
here, but check out the <a href="?page=devteam">dev team page</a>.
</p>

<h3>What are your goals about GoboLinux?</h3>

<p>
Our first goal is to have a system that we enjoy using, that won't get
destroyed by package managing software that tries to
administrate our machine for us. Most Linux distributions try to make
life easier to the novice user, but this way they are making life much
harder for the more seasoned user. We don't claim that GoboLinux is
easier, only that it "makes more sense". However, people who use it say
that it is indeed easier to administrate, given that it lets you
understand your system better (if you are willing to understand it).
</p>
<p>
As they say, "world domination is just a secondary goal". :)
</p>

<h3>Is there a performance loss in using symbolic links, making GoboLinux
a bad choice for, say, heavily loaded servers?</h3>

<p>
The short answer: theoretically yes, but no, we never measured it
(to know why "theoretically", read "the long answer"). 
</p>
<p>
The long answer: the actual impact of the use of symbolic links is
probably lower than you think. In a regular Linux distribution,
libraries are already accessed through symbolic links. In GoboLinux, our
links point directly to the actual file, so there is really one level of
indirection to reach a library. 
</p>
<p>
For example, take libc.so.6. It is in /lib, which is a link to
/System/Index/lib, but the actual file is in
/Programs/Glibc/Current, where Current is a link to 2.2.3, and inside
Glibc's lib directory you have that libc.so.6 is in fact a link to
libc-2.2.3.so. That's a lot of links right? However, libraries are
acessed like this: the directory /System/Index/lib (which is not a
link) is the only one stored in ldconfig's configuration (and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH). There libc.so.6 points directly to
/Programs/Glibc/2.2.3/lib/libc-2.2.3.so (no links in this whole path).
So we have exactly one level of indirection, just as in regular Linux
distributions. You may *see* a lot of links, but they are there mostly
to ease the system's management.
</p>
<p>
Applications are also compiled with the --prefix set to their "homes" at
/Programs/App/version, so when a program looks for a datafile it does
not go through links. Reaching executables involves going through one
link, but, unlike regular Linux distributions it does not have to search
through items of a PATH (and any modern filesystem's tree structuring
of a directory is probably more optimized than the shell's traversal through
elements of $PATH. Of course, there's always the shell's hash, but then,
there's always the filesystem cache).
</p>

<h3>Why do you use GoboHide? Can't you modify all programs to live in
the GoboLinux hierarchy?</h3>

<p>
We persuade them to cope with the GoboLinux tree with compilation 
options whenever possible. However, there are many programs that can't
cope completely, featuring hardcoded paths in their sources and whatnot.
Ultimately any free software can be patched to cope, but we don't 
have enough manpower for such a task and maintain it afterwards. 
It would be, at the very least, a big hassle, so we generally like to reduce 
the applied patches to the minimum.
At least /bin, /lib and /sbin are critical. We have made tests in a chrooted 
environment and it's funny to see all the weird things that happen when those 
are missing.
</p>

<h3>What is /Depot? What is /Files?</h3>

<p>
/Depot is a "free area" to store your documents, such as media files,
downloaded stuff, etc. You can think of it as a "community area", a "home
for all users" (some UNIX systems have a /pub directory for this purpose).
GoboLinux as a system ignores the contents of /Depot  it only exists to
encourage users to store their random files under a single place and keep
the rest of the system clean.
</p>
<p>
/Files, on the other hand, is a standard GoboLinux directory. Inside it,
there are directories such as Fonts and Plugins, where shared files that
are required by applications but not necessarily part of them are kept.
</p>

<h3>Who is Gobo?</h3>

<p>
Apart from Fibo, his loyal servant, no one who saw him survived to tell
the story. Beyond that, we never risked digging any deeper into the subject.
</p>

<h3>What nonsense is this?</h3>

<p>
Don't ask.
</p>

<h3>Are you serious?</h3>

<p>
Of course not. :-) You may disregard the two questions above -- they are
just one of the many internal jokes in the GoboLinux world. Gobo does
not exis-- uh, what's that? AAAAAHHHH!!!! <font color="white">;-) just
kidding</font>
</p>

<h3>Are you still there?</h3>

<p>
Yes.
</p>

<h3>Good! Who is the mascot? Is that Fibo?</h3>

<p>
No, the mascot is called Que. He's a penguin wearing Fibo's clothes.
