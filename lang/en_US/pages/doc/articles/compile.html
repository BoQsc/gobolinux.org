<h1>The ideas behind Compile</h1>

<p><i>Hisham Muhammad</i>, December 7th, 2003.</p>

<p><i><b>Note:</b> I had a very nice talk with Nathan last night on IRC, and I figured some 
things I said about the philosophy of Compile could be interesting for others 
to read too, so I saved the log. However, since we all know IRC logs are a 
pain to read, I'll try to do an adaptation here, so here we go:</i></p>

<p>
More than once I referred jokingly to Compile as "the poor-man's portage". Not 
because it is not as feature-rich (though that is indeed true), but because 
it is much more minimalistic by design.
</p><p>
In the Linux world we live today, we are surrounded by tons of distribution 
formats for the same programs: .tgz's, .deb's, .rpm's... and even variants of 
the same format (SuSE rpm's, RedHat rpm's, Mandrake rpm's...). A program may 
have all of these formats available, but, especially for less fundamental 
programs, there is usually just a subset, leading the user to the one 
distribution format that is guaranteed to exist: the original .tar.gz file 
containing the sources.
</p><p>
Most of the time, this .tar.gz file can be simply unpacked, and then three 
magic commands, "configure, make, make install", will do the trick. 
Dependencies are checked by configure and the program is linked to the 
correct libraries present on your system, with no incompatibilities. So, if a 
.tar.gz is decently put together, and follows a few GNU conventions, there is 
no reason why it couldn't work in any Linux distributions. Therefore, 
ideally, no distribution formats would be needed at all, and we could live 
only with the .tar.gz files.
</p><p>
Many projects are trying to "universalize" the distribution formats in one way 
or another: AutoPackage, LSB, and many others. A problem I see in most of 
them is that they usually end up "adding layers" of project-specific things, 
each in its own way, tainting the (let's call it) "agnosticity" of the 
original .tar.gz.
</p><p>
Projects like GNU Autoconf and GNU Libtool on the other hand make it easy to 
fit a program into the most diverse environments, without requiring the 
system to be "this" or "that" way in order to have the package work. 
Supporting a few Autoconf features (--prefix, --sysconfdir...), a program is 
as GoboLinux-friendly as we need it to be. No need to have our own package 
format to store or manage sources, or to store "our versions" of each 
project's sources. As Nate properly said, "you can go to the project's 
website, download the application and install... and not look for specific 
packages or have to use only "your distro's" site".
</p><p>
While support for Autoconf and other GNU projects is improving, leading them 
to more and more to become de-facto standards in the free software world, we 
know today's reality is not as nice. So, in the meantime, we have Compile and 
the Recipes tree.
</p><p>
Compile was designed based on this vision. The Recipes are not a detailed file 
in the vein of ebuilds, rpm spec files and similar. Ideally, they are not to 
be understood as an imperative script that, well, scripts how a program is 
built, but rather as a declarative file that describes what the compilation 
process is like.
</p><p>
Compile is based on the fact that there a few standard ways that sources are 
distributed, and that there are lots of minor variations that can be 
declaratively specified. Each of these ways is an "execution model", and 
support for them is implemented separately. There are three main execution 
models: 'compileprogram' (which covers configure-based files), 'makefile' 
(which covers configure-less make/make-install projects) and 'xmkmf' (which 
covers apps based on the X imake tools). There is an additional execution 
mode, 'meta', which provides meta-packaging support (merging many packages 
into one).
</p><p>
An ideal Recipe looks like this:
</p><pre>
url=$httpSourceforge/gphoto/libgphoto2-2.1.3.tar.bz2
is_compileprogram=yes
</pre><p>
Two lines, no more than that. And I plan to make 'compileprogram' the default 
method, so that would go down to one line. Before starting this whole Compile 
project, I knew that the maintenance effort for the Recipes tree would be the 
hardest part of it (actually, that mainenance cost is what kept me from 
starting it for so long). So the top priority was to keep the maintenance 
effort for keeping the Recipes tree updated as low as possible. I think you 
couldn't go much lower than what I achieved so far.
</p><p>
Once you have a basic execution method, here is where the "features creep in". 
Compile supports additional declarations to describe the minor variations 
that exist in the various build systems for the programs out there. For 
example, for PSUtils, Makefile is called Makefile.unix, so you'd add
</p><pre>
makefile=Makefile.unix
</pre><p>

Once you unpack audacity-src-1.0.0-2.tar.gz, Audacity's sources are not in 
audacity-src-1.0.0-2 as expected, but in audacity-src-1.0.0, so you add
</p><pre>
dir=audacity-src-1.0.0
</pre><p>

And so on. There are quite a few interesting declarations, such as 
configure_options in the 'compileprogram' execution model and 
'make_variables' in the 'makefile' model (also supported in 
'compileprogram'). Unfortunately, a non-neglectable number of packages also 
requires imperative pre- and post- build/install scripts, in order to perform 
very-non-standard tasks. Shell script functions are supported for those 
cases.
</p><p>

So, what the Recipes tree aims to be is a knowledge base that tells you (or, 
more precisely, Compile) how standard the compilation process of a program 
is. We hope that free software development will evolve as to turn the Recipes 
tree into just a bunch of URLs. :-)
</p><p>

Right now, Compile/Recipes is designed as a file-based system, meaning that 
all recipes are stored locally. Storing the recipes in the server and 
downloading them on-the-fly is a logical and planned future direction. 
The latest Compile/Recipes snapshot contains all the scripts and all the 
recipes we have so far. It features 150+ packages, and it is only 68k in 
size, so this is probably a good thing.
</p><p>

As a perspective, I recall Debian supports about 4000 packages, and Gentoo 
already features a similar number. I heard somewhere that the BSD ports 
collection has 8000 packages. Given that the Compile project was unveiled, 
IIRC, less than a month ago, I think we're progressing fairly well. Most 
importantly, I believe our project has the potential to scale up well too, 
given than maintaining our recipes is orders of magnitude less work than 
maintaining .deb's or spec files.
</p><p>

I encourage you to try out Compile and contribute us Recipes. To use Compile, 
unpack the latest snapshot at /Depot. The latest snapshot can be found at:
</p><p>

http://gobolinux.org/~lode/GoboLinux/
</p><p>

(and it also usually requires the latest Scripts package, which you can 
always find in <a href="http://gobolinux.org">gobolinux.org</a>).
</p><p>

Compile is packaged in an ad-hoc manner because for now I want to keep the 
scripts and recipes in a single package... they're evolving fast. Once they 
stabilize a bit, the plan is to make proper <tt>/Programs/Compile</tt> and 
<tt>/Files/Recipes</tt> entries. The next step will be, then, moving recipes to the 
server.
</p><p>

(By now you might be thinking: all this talk is about sources... what about 
the binary packages? Well, binary packages are built from sources, so the 
most important think to focus on managing sources first, as binaries "follow" 
from them).
