This week we had another release of GoboLinux, and again a number
of people, even if indirectly, called me “clueless” for coming
up with such a structure for a Linux distribution, for a number of
reasons. None of those reasons was new; I heard all of them many times.
This article is an attempt to sum them up, and explain why I chose
the design decisions I made, hopefully clearing any pending misconceptions.
I don't have illusion this will prevent them keep happening, but at
least I'll have a text to point people to. This article ranges from
common misconceptions from those who have never used GoboLinux, to
well-intentioned but poorly-thought-out ideas that keep coming from
time to time to the GoboLinux mailing list, often causing long debates.
I'll be separating the points in sections and they are meant to be
self-contained, so feel free to skip directly to the ones that interest
you, if you don't feel like reading the whole thing.

<P>

<h2>
“There is a reason why things are the way they are”
</h2>

<P>
This is something I hear constantly, often followed by an explanation
about the difference between <TT>/</TT>, <TT>/usr</TT> and <TT>/usr/local</TT>,
and/or <TT>/bin</TT> and <TT>/sbin</TT>. I do understand the difference<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot176"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. If I did away with this three-level distinction, is because I believe
there are other ways to approach the problems this distinction tries
to solve. In a GoboLinux system, the argument for having separate
<TT>/usr</TT> and <TT>/usr/local</TT> trees in order to separate programs
shipped by the distribution and compiled by the user clearly does
not hold. Each program is naturally separated, and this was the prime
intention of creating GoboLinux in the first place.

<P>
The historical reason why Unix systems have some of its tree directly
at the root partition (<TT>/bin</TT>, <TT>/lib</TT>, <TT>/sbin</TT>)
as opposed to having it under <TT>/usr</TT>, is because this way you
can boot in a bare-bones single-user rescue mode using those files
only, in order to fix problems in the <TT>/usr</TT> tree. This is
arcane. When I need to rescue my system, I can use a fully-featured
live CD that runs a complete Linux distribution with a graphical desktop,
that allows me to browse the web and search for the solution to my
problem, and use all of the features of a regular system to fix it.
I understand the rationale for having a bare-bones rescue mode decades
ago, but we have a better solution in our hands now.

<P>
The distinction between <TT>bin</TT> and <TT>sbin</TT> makes no sense,
in the present context. Historical evolution led to crazy arbitrary
distinctions, like <TT>ping</TT> and <TT>traceroute</TT> lying in
different directories (I fail to see how can they be of distinct “program
classes”, by any measure). Unix systems have a permissions system.
If one wants only the superuser to be able to run a command, then
<TT>chmod 700</TT> it. I suspect the separation could have been conceived
to reduce the number of programs in the <TT>$PATH</TT> of regular
users. In today's Linux systems, having 400 or 500 programs in your
<TT>$PATH</TT>, does not make any difference.

<P>
There is one last argument, however, that is still valid for Linux
systems to day: partitioning and remote mounting. Those two are really
different shades of the same color, with remote mounting being, to
my eyes, the most valid concern of those two. I've seen arguments
about this among the lines of “hard drives today are cheap, and
you'll most likely have all software installed locally anyway, for
performance”. I agree with this, but I also understand the ones
who'd like to maintain things centralized for administrative purposes.
But imposing additional complexity on the overall system because of
one particular scenario is usually not a good thing, and even then,
the traditional Unix solution is not general enough: what if you have
three or four application servers? You'll mount one at <TT>/usr</TT>,
one at <TT>/opt</TT>, and then what? There goes the traditional Unix
tree. In fact, in most of the larger Unix networks I had contact with,
particular needs of the site configuration led to non-standard directories
added to the Unix tree.

<P>
Fortunately, like with the live CD, we have nowadays a technological
advancement that serves as a real solution to the problem: <I>union
mounts</I>, also known as <I>overlay filesystems</I>. The idea is that
you can mount several partitions in the same directory. This way,
the semantics of <TT>/Programs</TT> as “the collection of all
programs available in the system” is retained, independently of
the physical location of the actual data. File systems are all about
abstraction (we don't refer to files based on their track, sector
and cylinder address), this progresses a step further. Overlay filesystems
are very flexible: the sysadmin, for example, can overlay site-specific
settings for an application on top of the defaults exported over NFS.
Unfortunately, it is not in widespread use, for reasons beyond my
understanding. The Plan 9 operating system has it as one of its basic
filesystem operations: the <TT>bind</TT> command (in Plan 9, for example,
you don't need a <TT>$PATH</TT> variable, because all directories
containing executables are “bound” in a single directory). There
is an implementation of an overlay filesystem for Linux: <TT>ovlfs</TT>.

<P>

<h2>
The alleged user-friendliness of longer names
</h2>

<P>
Many, many people, when they stumble upon GoboLinux, look at the long,
descriptive directory names and say “Look! They changed the Linux
directory names by making them longer and descriptive to make the
system friendly!”. There is some people who say this as if this
were a good thing, and some people who say this as if this were a
bad thing. Both are wrong.

<P>
There is a number of reasons why the names in GoboLinux are the way
they are, and none of them is “to attract new users who are scared
by <TT>/etc</TT> and the like”. The number one reason is: to not
conflict with the Unix namespace. And when I say Unix namespace I
actually mean the Linux namespace, which is not a very well settled
thing. This is not like a set of reserved keywords from a programming
language that says not to use <TT>if</TT>, <TT>while</TT>, <TT>repeat</TT>,
etc. as variable names and the rest is okay. You never know what directories,
files and programs will show up tomorrow, so the best I could do was
to pick names that were very unlikely to be ever used. Others did
that before me, and that worked, so I followed their example: NeXT
and Mac OS X had to make their own directories coexist with Unix directories,
so they capitalized the names, and while they were at it, they used
full words instead of abbreviations. The abbreviations were a sign
of the times from the origins of Unix. Dennis Ritchie once said that
if he could go back in time and change only one thing in Unix, he'd
rename the <TT>creat</TT> system call to <TT>create</TT>.

<P>
The one thing that reassures me that my decision was right is that,
when we started with GoboLinux, back in the days of Linux 2.4.something,
someone asked me “why didn't you pick <TT>/sys</TT> instead of
<TT>/System</TT>? That would be easier to type”. You can guess what
would have happened, now that the kernel guys reserved <TT>/sys</TT>
for their own use. In fact, the concerns on typing-friendliness always
comes up in discussions about the GoboLinux tree. To that, I can only
respond that, in a properly configured shell like the one that comes
by default with GoboLinux, typing <TT>/Programs</TT> takes the exact
same number of keystrokes as typing <TT>/usr</TT>: slash, lowercase
<TT>p</TT>, Tab.

<P>
One could also ask: but why change the directories, for starters?
Why not simply use the regular directory tree and make it behave like
GoboLinux? Yes, I suspect it could be possible, but from an operating
system design standpoint, I don't like the idea. I am not comfortable
with the concept of a system where well-known directories have different
semantics to those that most people expect. AtheOS, for example, has
this problem. You see a <TT>/usr</TT> directory, but that is no <TT>/usr</TT>.
In AtheOS, it behaves more like <TT>/opt</TT>, but unexplicably keeping
the name that historically stood for “user” and then was turned
into a backronym for Unix System Resources. Even if Kurt Skauen called
it <TT>/opt</TT>, it would still be strange; those are not “optional
packages”.

<P>
The GoboLinux directories, too, have different semantics from the
Unix directories. <TT>/Programs</TT> is the collection of all programs
available in the system, where each subdirectory contains all files
from a given program (the distinction of a program package is up to
the developers of each project; the various tools from <TT>CoreUtils</TT>
form a single program). Each subdirectory in /System/Links contains
a <I>view</I> (in the database sense of the term) of each file class
from the programs collection: libraries, executables, headers, and
so on<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot177"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. You see, these directories are not the Unix directories, they function
differently, from an administrative point of view. I believe it is
good design to make this explicit in the names.

<P>
For strict compatibility reasons, however, we have an extra set of
symbolic links with the Unix names pointing to the closest GoboLinux
equivalents (even making a few concessions in the GoboLinux side of
the equation in order to preserve this compatibility). The fact that
these are links, and we call them the <I>legacy</I> tree keeps this
notion very clear. The work of Lucas Villa Real and Felipe Damasio
on GoboHide, the kernel patch for true hidden directories on Linux,
further isolates the legacy tree as an isolated accessory.

<P>

<h2>
Do you want to change the standard?
</h2>

<P>
Of course not. For starters, we're not that naive to think that we
could. But the actual reason why we don't want to change the standard
is because we believe <I>there should be no standard</I>. I know this
statement may sound even bolder than talking about changing a standard,
but the reason I say that is because we believe it is the duty of
each application to allow itself to be installed anywhere and to accept
that other applications it needs to work with may be installed anywhere
(more on this in the next section). Now, if there was a standard stating
this, I'd even sign a petition to support it. In fact, there is: the
GNU release standards, when they recommend the usage of GNU Autotools,
supporting the <TT>-prefix</TT> family of switches, and probing
for the location of applications with the configure script, do just
that. But when a proposed standard like the FHS gives me an arbitrary
list of binaries that should be, for unexplained reasons, in a separate
directory, I laugh at that.

<P>
Different situations imply different needs, and so-called standards
that attempt to fit every feet in the same shoe are doomed to failure.
Standardize on flexibility instead. That's not we don't propose the
GoboLinux tree as a standard to be followed by anyone else. In five,
ten or twenty years, we may have completely different needs from the
ones we have today. I don't want that the move away from the GoboLinux
tree then to be as hard as the move away from the traditional Unix
tree is today. Which leads us naturally to our next section...

<P>

<h2>
An uphill battle to change all applications
</h2>

<P>
This is not as hard as it seems. Before the first version of GoboLinux
was fully built, I had already worked on and improved this model for
about a whole year. When André Detsch and I got around to build, in
two days, a system from scratch built around those concepts, I already
knew that this was perfectly feasible.

<P>
I work in an university environment, and I have for many years. There,
I am not the superuser, so I have to install every extra app I need
in my <TT>$HOME</TT> directory. This is a perfectly common situation,
it is expected that any decent application will allow this, and the
vast majority of them do. In fact, one could argue that an app that
doesn't has a broken build system. If you can install Gimp on <TT>/usr</TT>,
or <TT>/opt</TT>, or <TT>/home/hisham</TT>, then you can install it
on <TT>/Programs/Gimp/2.0/</TT>. Experience has shown that very few
applications need to have their Makefiles dissected in order to cooperate.
Even superuser-oriented software has (or should have) this flexibility:
in a regular Unix system, the superuser should have the option to
choose between, say, <TT>/sbin</TT> and <TT>/usr/sbin</TT>. There
is no reason to have hardcoded paths in programs and installers<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="#foot179"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.

<P>
A more delicate problem arises when a program, even though it allows
itself to be installed under any directory, wrongly assumes that another
programs it depends on is installed under the same directory. As you
can guess, this is a major source of problems for GoboLinux, but I
advocate this needs to be fixed for the benefit of the entire free
software community. Let's return to the <TT>$HOME</TT> directory
scenario. What if my favorite GNOME component was not installed by
the system administrator, and I want to install it in my <TT>$HOME</TT>,
while still using the rest of GNOME installed at <TT>/usr</TT>? Situations
like this, especially in big multi-component software, is often problematic.
There is a number of programs that solve this problem using a <TT>$PATH</TT>-like
environment variable: <TT>$GTKPATH</TT>, <TT>$PERL5LIB</TT>, <TT>$KDEDIRS</TT>,
<TT>$PYTHON_PATH</TT>, and so on. There is no reason to make a monolithic
installation a requirement.

<P>
So, the battle GoboLinux is fighting with regard to installation paths
is not specific to us; we are only exposing problems on the flexibility
of installation of applications, that happen not only in our tree,
but anywhere a user has a custom installation need. I see that the
situation has improved greatly in the last few years, with more and
more projects adopting GNU Autotools.

<P>

<h2>
“It's easier to compile all programs relative to the same tree”
</h2>

<P>
Sure it is. This is a point that comes up from time to time on the
GoboLinux mailing list, when people suggest us to either model <TT>/System/Links</TT>
after a regular Unix tree, with subdirectories such as <TT>bin</TT>,
<TT>lib</TT>, etc., or just compile everything relative to <TT>/usr</TT>
and let the legacy tree ensure that everything keeps working. People
who suggest this are also implicitly suggesting one of two things:
to compile relative to a tree and then install relative to another;
or to compile relative to a tree and then use a redirection hack on
installation. I don't like any of the two approaches. In the first
one, you are expecting a certain flexibility from the build system
that is not always there, but unlike the points I raised on the previous
section, it is not justifiable that this flexibility <I>should</I>
be in the application's build system in the first place<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="#foot107"><SUP>4</SUP></A>. As for the second approach, I don't like the idea of an operating
system built around a hack that can be at any moment circumvented
by a new system call or some unorthodox access method. Some might
say that GoboHide, for example, also falls in this “low-level
hack” territory. I point out, then, that GoboHide is not mandatory:
GoboLinux is designed to work with a vanilla Linux kernel<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="#foot181"><SUP>5</SUP></A>.

<P>
But instead of pointing flaws in the proposed alternatives, I'd prefer
to constructively defend my original design decision. Our idea, with
GoboLinux, is to exercise this new approach with self-contained directories
and assess its impact on system management, and we have been collecting
exciting results. If instead we just used every possible stratagem
to make apps “easier to compile”, I believe we would be detracting
ourselves from this goal. When I run <TT>ls -l /System/Links/Executables</TT>
and see <I>all</I> executables from my system, and the programs they
belong to, I see a clean system design. I would hate to look at <TT>/System/Links</TT>
(or whatever the directory would be called) and see within the Unix
mess emulated, with <TT>/bin</TT>, <TT>/sbin</TT>, and (<TT>$DEITY</TT>
forbid!) <TT>/usr/X11R6</TT>.

<P>

<h2>
“You want to turn Linux into a Windows-like!”
</h2>

<P>
If you read everything up to this point, I believe it should be clear
enough that we're not. If we were doing this to attract the Windows
users, a structural reorganization would be the last thing we would
do. Instead, we would concentrate on making the user interface look
like Windows, applying Windows-like themes, moving icons around, perhaps
integrating Wine tightly into the distribution, and so on. And that's
what Lindows, Lindash, Linspire, or whatever their name is today is
doing, not us.

<P>
It may sound extremely paradoxical, but we strive to keep the Linux
identity on the system. To be more precise, we strive for each project
to keep its own identity. Whenever possible, we ship every application
with unmodified sources. If you ever took the time to look inside
the <TT>.src.rpm</TT> files of any major distribution, you know what
I'm talking about: the vast majority of packages have patches to apply
little modifications here and there to modify this and that behavior;
be it to change the default state of a checkbox, or even to remove
the “About” box of an application! We don't do that. Our K menu
shows the KDE logo, and so does the KDE splash screen. We do ship
a theme with a custom wallpaper, but that is presented as an option
in the installer.

<P>
We go through great distances to ensure that our packages do not have
GoboLinux-specific bugs. The worst thing as a Linux user is to discover
that a given software works on distro X and doesn't on distro Y, and
not know if that is because distro Y introduced a custom patch that
caused the bug, or if it's because distro X introduced a patch that
fixed the bug. Speaking now as a developer, this is also a major headache.
Alexandre Julliard from Wine once said that the constant changes on
Linux distributions slow down the project more than the changes from
the Win32 API.

<P>
The fact that on GoboLinux all Unix library directories present all
libraries from the system, all header directories present all headers,
and so on, neutralizes many common compatibility problems between
distributions, causing us to be, ironically, one of the most compatible
distros, despite the unorthodox directory layout.

<P>

<h2>
The scope of a distribution
</h2>

<P>
Some people, perhaps excited by the fact that we made such a “big
change” in the structure of the operating system, occasionaly come
to us through the mailing list with this great idea about doing some
other big system-wide change that would improve GoboLinux considerably.
Sometimes this great idea is applicable, and we do apply them, like
when Carlo Calica integrated a daemon managing tool, <TT>Runit</TT>,
into GoboLinux<A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="#foot183"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. But most of the time the idea is something that would require all
applications to be greatly modified, if not rewritten. That is, obviously,
something we can't and are not willing to do. If we were talking about
a limited number of programs, some of them might even be feasible,
but people need to keep in mind that the universe of programs to be
used with GoboLinux is potentially infinite, as new Linux apps are
written every day.

<P>
To list just a few of the unfeasible ideas we were suggested, I could
mention:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>make all programs relocatable - I would love to see that, but that
would either mean: rewrite every app in the world to use <TT>libprefix</TT>,
store every dependency inside each program directory and have some
libraries on disk one hundred times (and deal with the clashes that
arise in a system that is not prepared for this), compile everything
relative to the same tree (I devoted an entire section above for this).
</LI>
<LI>make all programs use a unified configuration file format - Of course,
the rewrite effort that this would require is even greater than the
one from the previous item. Every idea that starts with “make
all programs...” tends to have the same problems: the effort is
potentially infinite; you can't make every project in the world agree
to use your solution; even if you could, there are many legacy systems
out there that just can't change even if they wanted, so incompatibility
issues would happen no matter what. Another idea of this class would
be to make all programs use the same graphic toolkit. Yeah, that would
look great and unify the Linux desktop, but it's just not going to
happen.
</LI>
<LI>turn entries on <TT>/Programs</TT> into AppDirs, because they look
so much like RiscOS - They may look like, but they are pretty different.
Yes, <TT>/Programs/Emacs</TT> could be made into an AppDir. <TT>/Programs/LyX</TT>
too. Hey, a lot of them could. But what about <TT>/Programs/FindUtils</TT>?
Or <TT>/Programs/KDE</TT>, what would happen when you click on that?
Another key issue is that AppDirs are relocatable by nature and GoboLinux
packages are not, a problem which I already covered above.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<h2>
Internationalization
</h2>

<P>
An often raised point is that “changing” names from things like
<TT>lib</TT> to things like <TT>Libraries</TT> is too English-centric
(“at least the old names were equally meaningless for everyone”)
and that we should do an effort to make the directory tree translatable.
I could dismiss this point raising a number of technical issues that
make this impractical, unless we are talking about hacks involving
symbolic links and the GoboHide kernel patch. But I won't do that.
I will, instead, assume that a clean and elegant way to translate
all GoboLinux directories existed, and ask “then what?”.

<P>
If people are willing to translate the directory tree in order to
make the system more friendly to those who don't speak English, I'm
sorry, but that won't help. A user that is defeated by the fact that
<TT>/System/Settings</TT> is not called <TT>/Sistema/Configurações</TT>
won't go very farther, once they reach this directory and need to
edit <TT>httpd.conf</TT>. The point I am trying to make is that the
kind of users that need internationalization won't be helped by a
translated directory tree. Efforts for translation should instead
be directed towards documentation and the user interface of programs.
If the user can read a manual in his/her language that tells him/her
to go to <TT>/System/Settings</TT> and do such and such change in
<TT>httpd.conf</TT>, this is much more useful than having the name
of the directory changed. If the user has a friendly GUI for configuring
Apache like the one provided by Mac OS X, he/she will probably like
it much more.

<P>

<h2>
Integration with other distros
</h2>

<P>
This is another point that is raised from time to time, in different
shapes, sizes and colors. The one reason I see people leaning towards
this idea is because of the huge libraries of ready-to-use software
provided by the other distributions. At first sight, the idea of combining
all the innovations of GoboLinux with the enormous package base of
distro X seems amazing. Looking closer, we'll see it's not.

<P>
First of all, there is the issue of the dependency systems. GoboLinux
has a very loose dependency system, designed to be resilient to user
customizations<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="#foot147"><SUP>7</SUP></A>. If you take advantage of these GoboLinux features, you won't be
able to auto-update system of distro X, and vice-versa. This way,
you would have to choose between using GoboLinux as if you were using
distro X, giving up much of the GoboLinux flexibility, or ignoring
the cool auto-update features from distro X. Either way, you would
give up on one of the reasons you started this integration project
in the first place.

<P>
Then, there are all of the little peculiarities of both distributions,
which you would have to be constantly dealing with: different boot
scripts, possible library incompatibilities, the “value-added”
package customizations of distro X... Not to mention the inability
to properly use Compile or the GoboLinux binaries repository, due
to, for example, different naming conventions of packages.

<P>
In short, even if you convert a whole system to use distro X's packages,
what you'll end up with is not a “turbo” GoboLinux, but a quirky
distro X. It is trivial to take, for example, all RPM's that compose
a RedHat system, unpack them, and symlink them to look like a GoboLinux
system. The resulting system, in the end, would pretty much be still
RedHat. Different people have done this, with different goals (some
to build a full distro, others just to convert a binary package or
two), with RedHat, Slackware, Debian and more recently Gentoo. The
general lesson I learned, from watching them do it, is that it is
not worth it.

<P>

<h2>
The root user
</h2>

<P>
Of course, I saved the best for last. The decision of naming user
zero something other than <TT>root</TT> is among the ones we are most
criticized for. The origins of this predate GoboLinux. On my experimental
system, my regular user was named <TT>hisham</TT>, and the superuser
<TT>lode</TT>. I never liked the Unix notion of “an arbitrary
<TT>root</TT> versus regular users” and wanted to see how well a
Linux system would behave without a <TT>root</TT> user. After a few
adaptations here and there, it worked very well. It was nice to know
that every time someone would try to log as <TT>root</TT> in my machine,
they would always fail.

<P>
When we made the hackathon that resulted in the first version of GoboLinux,
André and I decided to keep doing it. We chose <TT>gobo</TT>, an inside
joke. The intention of course, was to have a system that could support
a non-<TT>root</TT> superuser cleanly, but the users (a handful of
people back then) never changed the default and <TT>gobo</TT> somehow
got stuck. It is still possible to change the default without much
effort, though. For a short while I administered a set of machines
at the university, and, to have them blend with the NIS environment
more easily (the network was basically composed of RedHat boxes),
I changed the superuser from <TT>gobo</TT> back to <TT>root</TT>.
Now that GoboLinux has a graphical installer, we are considering putting
the superuser name as an installation-time option.

<P>
Now that I'm through with the historical explanation, one thing I
would like to point out that it is a well-known fact that the existence
of a single god-like entity is one of the weaknesses of the Linux
security model, and that is what bothered me with the notion of an
arbitrary <TT>root</TT> versus the rest of users; it is akin to a
single point of failure in a distributed system. The first thing every
project aiming to improve the security of Linux does is to increase
the granularity of the security model, do dilute the power of <TT>root</TT>:
ACLs, capabilities, SELinux... It may be argued that some of those
add excessive complexity to the model, but I won't dive into this
discussion here. The one thing that is clear is that the <TT>root</TT>
model is overly simplistic for today's complex systems, and that the
“setuid” kludge is the source of most security issues. Plan
9, for example, doesn't have a superuser at all; it offers a virtualized
view of the file system to each process. The <TT>gobo</TT> experiment
was an interesting assessment on how ingrained in the Linux world
is the expectation on having a <TT>root</TT> user; fortunately, not
much (it does not measure how attached the security model is to the
user #0, of course). One future direction I would like GoboLinux
to take (and in fact Linux in general) is to adopt some of the technologies
listed above as a way to improve the control over the system security
and administration; to detach ourselves from <TT>root</TT> was the
first step in this direction.

<P>

<h2>
Conclusions
</h2>

<P>
Well, I believe I covered a lot of ground in this article. I'm sure
I forgot many issues, but I think the most important ones are all
here. But the main idea I hope I passed here is that GoboLinux is
not just a cosmetic change in the filesystem. We are pretty much aware
of what we are doing, and what are the implications of the things
we are doing.

<P>
It is no secret that when I came up with the first versions of this
directory layout, I did not expect it to turn into a Linux distribution
used by people all around the world (even though it was shaped as
a distribution project as early as when Guilherme Bedin joined). The
one thing I'm most happy about is that the original goal, from way
back when it was not a proper distro, remains: a clean design.

<P>
I wholeheartedly agree with the quote in the beginning of the article,
and I definitely believe this is not the case.

 HREF="#tex2html1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>For those who always wondered (and those who want to check if I really
understand the difference), the three main trees divide, respectively,
files that need to be available in the root partition for single-user
rescue mode, program files managed by the distribution, and programs
added separately by the site admin (this distinction varies on different
Unices, but this is mainly how it works on Linux distributions, read
on for more). Regular programs go in <TT>/bin</TT>, and programs intended
for the superuser in <TT>/sbin</TT>.

<DT><A NAME="foot177">... on</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>On Plan 9 that could be done with a <TT>bind</TT> command; since we
don't have this in a vanilla Linux kernel, we do this with symbolic
links. But I have to admit I like the notion that the views are stored
in a persistent manner.

<DT><A NAME="foot179">... installers</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>An installer per se is a rare concept in Linux; what I mean by installer
here is usually the <TT>install</TT> target of a Makefile.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="foot107">... place</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>For those interested in this approach, I point you to GNU Stow. I
do not know, however, of any system built 100% with it, though.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="foot181">... kernel</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>If it were not, we could also, for example, build the <TT>/System/Links</TT>
views as union mounts using <TT>ovlfs</TT>.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="foot183">... GoboLinux</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html6"><SUP>6</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>The current trend on GoboLinux development is to loosen this integration,
making <TT>Runit</TT> an optional component, but still providing the
required framework to make it work.

</DD>
<DT><A NAME="foot147">...
customizations</A><A
 HREF="#tex2html7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></DT>
<DD>It's beyond the scope of this article to describe the GoboLinux dependency
system, but for example, if you install app A and it depends on B,
it won't complain if B was not installed with a vanilla package, and
if B is missing, it will report, but not refuse to install.
