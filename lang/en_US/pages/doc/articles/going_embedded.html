So, do you want to try Gobo on a different architecture? That's cool, and that's why      
this documentation was created for: we want to encourage you to join in the developers'            
corner with interesting experiments.             
</p>            
<p>            
More specifically, this documentation is here to guide you on porting Gobo to a new            
architecture, which might be focused on embedded or desktop usage. The steps, examples            
and tools shown on this document have reached a stable branch, being used in projects      
such as the Brazilian's Digital TV research, where a Gobo port to the SuperH has been      
done, as well as the Gobo ARM port.      
      
</p>      
<p>      
The remaining sections are going to focus on 2 ways of porting Gobo to a new system:            
by cross-compiling and by using an existing distribution as a basis to compile packages            
using the Gobo hierarchy.            
</p>            
           
<h3> Doing that by Cross-Compiling </h3>      
<p>           
While we try to make porting as easy as possible, doing this kind of task always needs           
some background on the subject. Cross compiling a whole set of packages and preparing           
the root filesystem requires that you have an understanding of the boot process, of the     
manual installation of a kernel image, shell scripts and many more. Reading other     
chapters of the GoboLinux Documentation Project might help you to acquire some of that knowledge.     
</p>           
<p>           
Finished with the introduction, let's make a list of what you'll need. Firstly, this           
tutorial assumes that you have <b>a host computer running Gobo</b>. The Gobo team has     
developed numerous tools to help on the automation of the system, such as compiling     
programs based on simple description files, detecting the latest versions of a given     
application, enjauling the compile process so that the host system doesn't interfere in           
the compilation environment, and so on.           
</p>           
<p>           
For this reason, the tools developed to aid on the port are based on Gobo's own           
infrastructure. After all, since you're porting Gobo to a new architecture we would           
expect at least that you're also running it on your host computer, right?           
</p>           
<p>           
Secondly, you'll need <b>a working cross-compiler</b>. Since we're going to create a           
distribution <i>from scratch</i> to a different architecture than the one running on the          
host system, that's the way we will generate programs to it. There are many          
cross-compilers ready for usage out there, and some scripts that might help you to    
prepare your own. The following projects and cross-compilers have been tested and are          
recommended:    
</p>          
<ul>          
<li>          
        <a href="http://kegel.com/crosstool">Crosstool</a>: Consists in a set of scripts            
        and patches to generate a toolchain for many architectures, such as Alpha, ARM,           
        i686, IA64, MIPS, PowerPC, PowerPC64, SH4, Sparc, Sparc64, s390 and x86_64. The           
        current toolchains used by Gobo developers were generated by this tool; <p>          
<li>          
        <a href="http://codesourcery.com">CodeSourcery</a>: This is the major source for           
        ARM toolchains, and is one of the leading companies developing the ARM EABI. If           
        you want to get a tested and ready-to-use cross compiler for ARM, this is the           
        place to get one;<p>          
<li>          
        <a href="http://uclibc.org">uClibc toolchain</a>: If you're looking for a very           
        small distribution it's probably better to look at this alternative. The uClibc           
        is a tiny libc implementation which targets devices with small storage           
        capabilities. Please note, however, that this might come with small performance     
        penalty on some applications.<p>          
</ul>          
<p>          
Finally, you'll need to write <b>cross-compiler rules for the Compile tool</b>. Compile          
has the ability to create binaries to different platforms, so there's a need to write a          
configuration file for the one you're going to use, respecting the naming convention          
<tt>Cross-<i>&lt;ARCH&gt;</i>.conf</tt>, where ARCH will represent the target architecture.          
Cross configuration files are stored at <tt>/System/Settings/Compile</tt>.          
</p>          
<p>          
The Compile tool ships 2 sample files for the ARM and SH4 architectures. Let's give a   
look into          
the variables exported by them, taking the ARM rule as reference:          
</p>          
<ul>          
<li>          
        <tt>cross_kernel_dir:</tt> specifies the path on which the kernel sources for           
        this platform are found. Since it's very usual to maintain the kernel for the            
        working platform on a special directory during development stage, you can do           
        that and just specify its location here; <p>      
</li>          
<li>    <tt>cross_kernel_version:</tt> for the same kernel, specifies its release, based           
        on the <TT>VERSION</TT>, <TT>PATCHLEVEL</TT>, <TT>SUBLEVEL</TT> and           
        <TT>EXTRAVERSION</TT> variables exported in the Makefile; <p>      
</li>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_kernel_arch:</TT> when cross compiling the kernel, one must call          
        "make menuconfig ARCH=<I>kernel_arch_name</I>". Specify your architecture's name           
        under the kernel tree here; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_prefix_dir:</TT> where in the host's filesystem the new filesystem           
        tree will be stored; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_toolchain_dir:</TT> where in the host's filesystem the toolchain is           
        installed; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_sys_incdir:</TT> path to ``stdio.h'' inside the toolchain's dir; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_gcc_incdir:</TT> path to ``stdarg.h'' inside the toolchain's dir;<p>       
</LI>

<LI>    <TT>cross_libc_libdir:</TT> path to ``libc.*'' files in the toolchain's dir; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_uname_m:</TT> output for ``uname -m'' on the target machine; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_configure_host:</TT> parameter to the configure script when building            
        applications based on autoconf (-host=<I>target_ machine_string</I>). This           
        string describes the CPU on which the binary generated will run on; <p>      
</LI>          
<LI>    <TT>cross_configure_build:</TT> parameter to the configure script when building           
        applications based on autoconf (-build=<I>build_cpu_string</I>). This string           
        describes the CPU which is doing the cross-compiling; <p>

<h3>The BootStrap tool</h3>      
<p>          
The process of creating a distribution from scratch involves many steps which are very          
error prone. Bootstrap is a tool which concentrates many scripts for these purposes,          
adding a menu-driven interface to make this task less focused on the details on          
<i>how</i> to generate things, but on <i>what</i> to install on the new filesystem.          
</p>      
<p>      
In short, Bootstrap performs the following steps:          
</p>         
<OL>         
<LI>    Creates a Gobo directory structure for the new port at           
        <TT>$cross_prefix_dir</TT>, defined in the cross config file; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Populates its /System/Kernel/Devices dir; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Creates system files at its /System/Settings; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Installs the Scripts and Compile packages on the new tree for usage during cross         
        compiling; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Installs BootScripts; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Prepares kernel headers to be used by Glibc cross-compilation; <p>
</LI>         
<LI>    Compiles packages selected by the user. <p>
</LI>         
</OL>         
<p>         
Given that the cross config file had been written, Bootstrap usage is pretty simple.         
Configuration is done by <I>make menuconfig</I>, where packages can be selected along        
with a target architecture and machine implementation. If you're porting Gobo to an        
architecture which is not listed by Bootstrap, you can create a new entry for it at        
<TT>functions/Platforms</TT> and at <TT>Config.in</TT> inside Bootstrap's root dir.         
</p>      
<img src="http://gobolinux.org/screenshots/apps/bootstrap-main.png">      
<p>         
At the end of <i>make</i>, the filesystem generated will be available at the directory 
specified at the cross config file, and will be ready for usage on the target platform. 
Files can always be modified manually after they are generated, as they're not 
overwritten by subsequent <i>make</i> calls. The filesystem can then be shared for 
remote mounting over NFS at boot time, or copied to different media, depending on your 
interests and resources available on your platform.
