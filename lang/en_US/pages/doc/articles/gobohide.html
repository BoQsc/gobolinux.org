<h3> A little bit of history </h3>                   
<p>                   
As you might have already seen, GoboLinux adopts an alternative directory                   
tree. As you might also be wondering, without the legacy tree a lot of                   
common applications wouldn't work in GoboLinux. This document explains                   
how this problem is solved by the distribution and how it's solved by other                   
operating systems which must address the same problem. If you simply don't

A long time ago, in a mailing list far, far away....                   
There was a discussion about how we could get rid of the legacy tree,                   
without actually removing it. We needed to keep it, but we just didn't                   
want to know it existed.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
Inspired by MacOS, Hisham suggested that we started by modifying our "l" script                   
(which is a wrapper for the 'ls' command): if an entry belonging to the                   
legacy tree was going to be listed, then it should be skipped, and the final                   
listing would only show the GoboLinux hierarchy tree.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
So, since all of the GoboLinux users at the time (that is, their developers)                   
used to use "l", this approach could be good enough.. for our shell needs.                   
MacOS uses an approach very similar to this: it keeps a file with the                    
directory names that should not be listed by the graphical interface. Their                   
toolkits then makes use of this file to avoid listing the legacy tree, and                   
everyone is happy.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
Of course, since we are dealing with a great variety of window managers and                   
interpreters, we couldn't adopt the same solution, or we would need to have                   
a great job modifying every application which handled with filenames.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
My suggestion was to hook these read operations directly in the root of the                    
problem: since every readdir() is performed by the kernel, then                   
we could have a list kept in kernel to check on every readdir() operation.                   
If the inode being read was present in this list, then it simply shouldn't be                   
copied onto the destination buffer, which should be returned to the user.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
This first implementation was hardcoded with my own inode numbers (relative                   
to the legacy tree), and this was when Felipe Damasio came with his kernel                   
abilities and created a better interface based on ioctls in order to register                   
the entries that should be hidden from the userspace, and then we got our                   
first release of GoboHide.                   
</p>                   
<p>                   
From these old days until now, GoboHide has been kept up to date to the                   
newer kernel versions. The patch now is fully integrated with the VFS, which means
that it works with any filesystem that supports directories and/or symlinks. It has
been tested with EXT2, EXT3, ISOfs, JFFS2, JFS, NFS, ReiserFS, SquashFS and XFS, but
certainly works with others, too.

<h3> And how can I interact with this wonderful piece of ioctls? </h3>                   
<p>                   
As mentioned before, its interface with the userland is made through ioctls,                   
hence an application is needed to talk with the kernel. There's a tool called                   
GoboHide (very intuitive, isn't it?) that can do the job for you:

<span class="prompt">~]</span> gobohide --help                   
                   
gobohide: Hide/Unhide a directory                   
                   
-h, --hide     Hide the directory                   
-u, --unhide   Unhide the directory

<p>                   
So, in order to hide a directory, one would need to run gobohide with '-h',                   
passing the target entry. A subsequent "ls" will not show the hidden entry,                   
then:

This allows one to hide an entry from the filesystem. But don't worry,                   
the superuser has power to ask the kernel for the entries being hidden, so                   
you can always be sure about what is being hidden in your system:                   
</p>                   
<div class="console"><div class="padding"><pre>                   
<span class="prompt">~]</span> gobohide -l                   
Hidden directories:

</pre></div></div>                   
<p>                   
And the best of it all: you can still access your files inside these hidden                   
entries, and even bash would tell you that files exist in these directories:

 Getting and applying the kernel patches and the userspace application </h3>                   
<p>                   
The GoboHide patch is already applied by default on the GoboLinux kernel.                    
In case you are compiling a different kernel release, you can grab the                   
patches which are contained inside the Linux kernel recipe and apply the GoboHide                   
patch in the usual way, as follows:
