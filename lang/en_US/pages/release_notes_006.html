<h3>
Known bugs/issues
</h3>

<p>
GoboLinux, like most free software, is in constant improvement.
Since it is still improving, it means it is not perfect. 
Since it is not perfect, it means it has bugs. Here's the list
of known bugs in the latest release (of course, they should all be fixed
until the next one).
</p>

<h4>
Installation
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The progress bar may not fill up to 100%, even though
the installation is complete. In this case, you can press "Q" at any
time (even before the installation is done) and the installer will
proceed correctly with the installation.
</ul>

<h4>
Use
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
To set the timezone, modify Glibc's <tt>localtime</tt> symlink inside
<tt>/Programs/Glibc/Settings</tt>. Modifying it inside
<tt>/System/Settings</tt> does not suffice. We intend to fix this.
<li>
The proprietary Java and Flash plugins at /Files/Plugins
(distributable free of charge
and available as a convenience) are linked to GCC 2 libraries. 
Either install GCC 2 (you can keep GCC 3 as Current version) or
update the plugins.
<li>
Not really a bug, but worth a comment: DHCP is listed as an
option in the network boot scripts, but DHCPCD is not installed
in the base system as default. Remember to install this package
if you intend to use DHCP.
<li>
The GCC packages were modularized late in the release process. Because
of this, some packages will complain that GCC is missing, even though
this is not true. Please ignore.
<li>
The dependency listings may show the same package several times.
This is harmless.
</ul>

<h4>Additional packages</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The Licq package does not include the Qt-only plugin, only the
KDE version.
<li>
Some ALSA utilities create state files in /System/Settings directly.
To have them stored inside ALSA-Utils, do:<br>
<tt> mkdir -p /Programs/ALSA-Utils/Settings<br>
touch /Programs/ALSA-Utils/Settings/{alsactl,asound.state}
</ul>
