<h1>Rootless GoboLinux</h1>

<p>
If you want to have a taste of how GoboLinux feels like before
installing the real thing, you have two options.
</p>
<p>
The first, recommended one, is to 
<a href="?page=downloads">download our CD image</a>, which is
also a "live CD", that is, a bootable Linux setup running GoboLinux
itself. You'll be able to check out our alternative directory
hierarchy and see for yourself how things are organized.
</p>
<p>
The second option, is to make a minimal installation of
the scripts and directory hierarchy inside your home directory. We
call it "Rootless GoboLinux". 
</p>

<p>
After installing Rootless, you will be able to install packages using 
the GoboLinux scripts and execute them inside your user environment, 
doing it the GoboLinux way. However, you won't be able to generate valid 
GoboLinux binary packages since all paths in your installations will be 
relative your particular home directory. GoboLinux Recipes should be 
compatible with normal and Rootless installations.
</p>

<p>
Rootless GoboLinux was created so that people who are using GoboLinux
at home can take advantage of our directory tree inside their user accounts
at places where they can't decide which Linux distribution they use
(eg, at work or at the university's lab). Don't hesitate to

<h3>Installing Rootless</h3>

<p>
In order to install Rootless GoboLinux, all you have to do is to download and run the 
CreateRootlessEnvironment script (you will need to run "chmod +x CreateRootlessEnvironment" in order to be able to execute the downloaded file).
</p>
<p>
The above mentioned script does some simple tasks. Basically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of stub "Programs" and "System" directories</li>
<li>Installation of the Scripts package</li>
<li>Creation of a 'StartRootless' scripts, which is sourced within ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Requirements:</h4>

<p>
CreateRootlessEnvironment and the GoboLinux scripts assume the basics of a GNU userland
available (which is usually not an issue in Linux-based systems, but may not be the case
in other ones). Before running the script, make sure at least these tools are available in your
$PATH:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/">GNU Bash</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/coreutils/">GNU CoreUtils</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed/">GNU Sed</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/">GNU Wget</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Uninstalling Rootless</h3>
<p>
If you need for any reason to remove Rootless later, it's just a matter of taking away ~/Programs,
 ~/System and ~/.Settings -- pretty simple.
</p>

<!--
</p>
<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<li>Download the 
above file and extract it to in your home directory.</li> <br/>
<li>If your are using <b>bash</b>, add the following line to your .bashrc:
<br/><i>. ~/Programs/Rootless/Settings/StartGobo</i></li><br/>
<li>If you want to use <b>zsh</b>, Rootless come with a specially prepared zshrc file, that can be used adding
the following line to your .zshrc file. Notice that in this case, you don't need to source explicitly the "StartGobo" file. 
<br/><i>. ~/Programs/Rootless/Settings/zshrc-rootless</i></li>
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>
The rootless installation contains by default some packages:
<li><i>Atools, Mtail, Scripts</i>: packages identical to the
used in normal GoboLinux installations;</li>
<li><i>Rootless</i>: contains files that are specific to Rootless GoboLinux (so you can
easily upgrade your Rootless GoboLinux when a new version comes out); and</li>
<li><i>EquivalentPaths</i>: contains a system call wrapper (activated calling ". equivalet_paths.rc")
that enables you to run some packages compiled for "/Programs" inside your "~/Programs". Notice
that it is not activated by default, since it is still in a development stage.</li>
</p>
