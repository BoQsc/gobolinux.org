<h1>Rootless GoboLinux</h1>

You can install GoboLinux in your home directory under
another Linux distribution and run GoboLinux applications as
an unpriviledged user.

<p>
We call this type of installation "Rootless GoboLinux." 

<p> After installing Rootless, you will be able to build
software using recipes, and run these programs in the
GoboLinux way.

<p>
Rootless GoboLinux lets you use a GoboLinux development
environment in situations where you don't have a choice of
operating system. Rootless also works under OSX, and in Cygwin
and (probably) the new Linux subsystem under Windows.

<p>One limitation under Rootless is that you won't be able
to install or generate binary packages, since your
installation will be relative to your particular home
directory.  </p>

<h3>Installing Rootless</h3>

<p>
In order to install Rootless GoboLinux, all you have to do is to download and run the 
CreateRootlessEnvironment script (you will need to run "chmod +x CreateRootlessEnvironment" in order to be able to execute the downloaded file).
</p>
<p>
The above mentioned script does some simple tasks. Basically:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of stub "Programs" and "System" directories</li>
<li>Installation of the Scripts package</li>
<li>Creation of a 'StartRootless' scripts, which is sourced within ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc</li>
</ul>

<h4>Requirements:</h4>

<p>
CreateRootlessEnvironment and the GoboLinux scripts assume the basics of a GNU userland
available (which is usually not an issue in Linux-based systems, but may not be the case
in other ones). Before running the script, make sure at least these tools are available in your
$PATH:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/">GNU Bash</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/coreutils/">GNU CoreUtils</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed/">GNU Sed</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/wget/">GNU Wget</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Uninstalling Rootless</h3>
<p>
If you need for any reason to remove Rootless later, it's just a matter of taking away ~/Programs,
 ~/System and ~/.Settings -- pretty simple.
</p>

<!--
</p>
<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<li>Download the 
above file and extract it to in your home directory.</li> <br/>
<li>If your are using <b>bash</b>, add the following line to your .bashrc:
<br/><i>. ~/Programs/Rootless/Settings/StartGobo</i></li><br/>
<li>If you want to use <b>zsh</b>, Rootless come with a specially prepared zshrc file, that can be used adding
the following line to your .zshrc file. Notice that in this case, you don't need to source explicitly the "StartGobo" file. 
<br/><i>. ~/Programs/Rootless/Settings/zshrc-rootless</i></li>
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>
The rootless installation contains by default some packages:
<li><i>Atools, Mtail, Scripts</i>: packages identical to the
used in normal GoboLinux installations;</li>
<li><i>Rootless</i>: contains files that are specific to Rootless GoboLinux (so you can
easily upgrade your Rootless GoboLinux when a new version comes out); and</li>
<li><i>EquivalentPaths</i>: contains a system call wrapper (activated calling ". equivalet_paths.rc")
that enables you to run some packages compiled for "/Programs" inside your "~/Programs". Notice
that it is not activated by default, since it is still in a development stage.</li>
</p>
