<h2>GoboLinux 007 - Release notes / Known issues</h2>

<p>
This page collects relevant information concerning GoboLinux version
007. This file can be considered a companion to the documentation included in
the CD, and will be regularly updated as we get feedback in the mailing list.

<h3>
Known bugs/issues
</h3>

<h4>
On the installed system
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
makeinfo binary from Texinfo is was not correctly linked (due to an conflict with TeTex makeinfo).
Running "SymlinkProgram -c overwrite Texinfo" is recommended for everybody that installed 007.
<li>
GDKXFT has a missing dependency in the CD, the FreeType package.
Download it at the packages pages if you plan to use GDKXFT.
<li>
Though listed in the menu.lst file, GRUB is not compiled with splashimage
support. The graphical bootloader from the CD is IsoLinux.
<li>
The patches stored in /Depot/Sources/Linux are not correct. To use the
kernel sources, revert the patches with patch -R and, if desired, apply
only the GoboHide patch. To access the compressed loopback image from 
the ISO, compile the <a href="http://developer.linuxtag.net/knoppix/sources/cloop_2.00-1.tar.gz">cloop module</a> separately.
<li>
Problems have been reported with supermount. It is not enabled by default,
and we reccomend avoiding its use.
</ul>



<h4>
Running LiveCD
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Some programs available inside CD didn't run as well as they should. Running 
a 'full' GoboLinux within CD is a recent feature and is being improved gradually.
Some detected problems are listed bellow (if you know a solution to some of them, 
<a href="mailto:NO_SPAM___gobo@gobolinux.org">email us</a>):<br>
<b>-</b> TeTex does not work;<br>
<b>-</b> To run some application within KDE without using an terminal (e.g., menus, ALT+F2), 
you need to specify the full path to it (/bin/<application> is enough). The PATH environment 
variable seems not to be used.<br>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Up to now, we did'nt have any unsolved booting problem with the GoboLinux 007  CD.
 If the CD does not boot in your machine, try disabling the DMA option for your CDROM in the BIOS.
</ul>
