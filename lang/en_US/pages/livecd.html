<h1>Tweaking the GoboLinux LiveCD: a tutorial</h1> 
 
<p> This is a quick guide to the internals of how the GoboLinux Live CD 
is constructed. It will get you up to speed with the tools that build 
the CD, allowing you to make customizations. With this we hope to lower 
the entry barrier to potential contributors to the distro's development. 
</p> 
 
<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 
 
<p> This tutorial assumes you're running a GoboLinux system, with the 
most recent version of the <span class="pkg">Scripts</span> package 
installed. Your kernel needs to support <a 
href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html">UnionFS</a>, <a 
href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/">SquashFS</a> and <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramfs">CramFS</a>. You also need the  
<span class="pkg">SquashFS-Tools</span> installed. All of this is 
available from the GoboLinux repositories. </p> 
 
<div class="Warning Box"> 
<table><tr><td> 
<img class="BoxIcon" src="<<root>>/images/warning.png" alt="Warning"/> 
</td><td> 
 
This tutorial assumes all steps are performed with superuser privileges 
(become superuser with <span class="cmd">su</span> or use <a 
href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/"><span 
class="cmd">sudo</span></a>). This is because the tools need to create 
device nodes, unpack files keeping privileges and suid bits and perform 
mounts using UnionFS. As usual, care must be taken when performing tasks 
as superuser, when running pre-release software downloaded through SVN 
and especially, when doing both, as it's the case here. Proceed at your 
own risk.

<h2>The tools</h2> 
 
<p> To get started, you need to install the <span class="pkg">BuildLiveCD</span> 
package. 
You can install it by typing: </p> 
 
<pre> 
Compile buildlivecd 
</pre> 
 
<p> A number of other GoboLinux tools and packages will be involved in 
the process of building the CD, but this is the only one you need to 
install in your <span class="dir">/Programs</span> directory. We'll get 
to them in detail one by one, but here's an overview: </p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li><span class="pkg">InitRDScripts</span> - this is the "Scripts" package for the 
mini-GoboLinux environment in which the CD kernel is loaded </li> 
 
<li><span class="pkg">LiveCD</span> - scripts that are specific to the Live CD 
environment, having to do mostly with its initialization. </li> 
 
<li><span class="pkg">ConfigTools</span> - some scripts that tweak configuration files 
to 
match the system where they're running. </li> 
 
<li><span class="pkg">Installer</span> - the actual installation program, that copies 
the 
contents of the CD to the hard disc </li> 
 
<li><span class="pkg">AbsTK</span> - <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/abstk">Abstract 
Tool Kit</a>: the interface abstraction library that allows the 
Installer to have both text-mode and graphic interfaces. </li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h2>The CD mastering environment</h2> 
 
<p> Once you have BuildLiveCD installed in your system, you can set up 
the CD mastering environment. A single command creates the necessary 
directories and downloads all needed packages: <span 
class="cmd">UpdateEnvironment</span>. Run it in an empty directory; 
in our examples we'll use <span class="dir">/Depot/LiveCD</span>. </p> 
 
<pre> 
mkdir /Depot/LiveCD 
cd /Depot/LiveCD 
UpdateEnvironment 
</pre> 
 
<p> Note that this will download hundreds of megabytes worth of 
packages, so this may take a while. </p> 
 
<div class="DevInfo Box"> 
<table><tr><td> 
<img class="BoxIcon social_thumbnail" src="<<root>>/images/goboicon.png" alt="Dev Info"/> 
</td><td> 
 
<b>For GoboLinux devs</b>: This script downloads some files from SVN and 
stores a local copy of the SVN repository under <span 
class="dir">LocalSVN/</span>. To ease development, you may want to have 
a copy with write access enabled, instead of the default anonymous SVN 
copy. To do this, pass your <a 
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org">Savannah</a> username as an additional 
parameter to <span class="cmd">UpdateEnvironment</span>. 
 
<pre> 
UpdateEnvironment hisham 
</pre> 
 
If your username in the local machine is not the same as your Savannah 
username, you can pass it as a <i>second</i> parameter (since you're 
running as superuser, the script will "sudo" to your user account when 
running <span class="cmd">svn</span>).

</div> 
 
<h2>Building the CD</h2> 
 
<p> The whole process of building the CD is wrapped by the <span 
class="cmd">CompressAndBuildISO</span> script. In your first run, you 
can simply call it with no parameters and it will go through the whole 
process: </p> 
 
<pre> 
CompressAndBuildISO 
</pre> 
 
<p> The script is composed of a few stages -- when you make a 
modification that affects only one of the later stages, you can pass a 
parameter to have it skip the earlier ones, in order to save time. The 
stages are: </p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li><span class="cmd">rolayer</span> - Constructs the directory tree with the contents 
of 
the LiveCD: uncompresses packages building a <span 
class="dir">/Programs</span> tree, files into <span 
class="dir">/Files</span>, and generates a <span 
class="dir">/System</span> directory with the necessary symbolic links 
and system files. </li> 
 
<li><span class="cmd">squashfs</span> - Compresses this newly-constructed system into 
several SquashFS images: one for <span class="dir">/Files</span>, a few 
ones for sections of the big <span class="dir">/Programs</span> tree, 
and one for the rest (<span class="dir">/System</span>, <span 
class="dir">/Mount</span>, <span class="dir">/Users</span>...). This is 
done so that modifications on part of the filesystem do not trigger a 
full regeneration of the entire system's "squashed image" (a process 
which takes several minutes even on a 2+GHz machine). </li> 
 
<li><span class="cmd">initrd</span> - Because the actual system is stored in the CD in a 
compressed format, its contents cannot be directly accessed by the disc 
bootloader. The bootloader launches instead an InitRD ("initial 
RAM-disk") image, a mini-GoboLinux system that serves the sole purpose 
of hosting the kernel, mounting the SquashFS system, and booting into 
it. This step of <span class="cmd">CompressAndBuildISO</span> creates 
the CramFS image of this mini-GoboLinux to be used as the InitRD. </li> 
 
<li><span class="cmd">iso</span> - In the final step, the ISO 9960 file system is 
generated, containing the bootloader, the kernel, the InitRD image and 
the SquashFS files. </li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h2>A walkthrough of the Live CD boot process</h2> 
 
<h3>The CD bootloader</h3> 
 
<p> <i>To be written</i> </p> 
 
<h3>The InitRD environment</h3> 
 
<p> <i>To be completed</i> </p> 
 
<p> The InitRD environment is a mini-GoboLinux system created by the 
<span class="cmd">MakeInitRDTree</span> script, which was called when 
you run <span class="cmd">CompressAndBuildISO</span>. You will find it 
at the <span class="dir">Output/InitRD</span> directory. </p> 
 
<p> Do not modify <span class="dir">Output/InitRD</span> directly: its 
contents are rewritten when <span class="cmd">CompressAndBuildISO</span> 
runs through the <span class="cmd">initrd</span> step. To tweak the 
InitRD scripts, modify instead the local SVN copy of <span 
class="cmd">InitRDScripts</span>, located at <span 
class="cmd">LocalSVN/tools/InitRDScripts</span>. </p> 
 
<p> Currently, this part of the build environment is not very friendly 
to customized versions. If you want to keep a custom version of the 
InitRD, you need to replace <span class="dir">LocalSVN/InitRD</span> 
with your own copy after running <span 
class="cmd">UpdateEnvironment</span>. </p>

<b>For GoboLinux devs</b>: To have your changes done permanently, there 
are a few different places where they may need to be applied: 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Changes to <span class="dir">/Programs/InitRDScripts</span> should 
be comitted to the GoboLinux SVN. If your <span 
class="dir">LocalSVN/</span> copy was created with write access, it's 
only a matter of running <span class="cmd">svn commit</span>. </li> 
 
<li>Other entries in <span class="dir">/Programs</span> are fetched from 
the <span class="dir">initrd-packages/</span> repository (see the <span 
class="cmd">MakeInitRDTree</span> script for details). </li> 
 
<li>The directory structure and other configuration files are generated 
by <span class="cmd">MakeInitRDTree</span>, so if you change that, 
modify it accordingly so that a clean rebuild creates the files and 
structure as you intend it. </li> 
 
</ul> 
 
</td></tr></table> 
</div> 

<p>At the end of the <span class="cmd">startGoboLinux</span> script of
the <span class="cmd">InitRDScripts</span> package, the SquashFS images
are mounted, the pivot operation to make it the root directory is performed
and <span class="cmd">init</span> is called to proceed with the boot process.
</p>

<h3>Inside SquashFS</h3>

<p> From there on, we're inside a GoboLinux system very much like the one that's
installed in the hard disk. In fact, the same packages are used. When <span class="cmd">init</span>
runs, it calls the <span class="cmd">BootDriver</span> from the BootScripts package.
The <span class="cmd">BootDriver</span> detects it is running from the Live CD, so 
instead of running its usual bootscripts, it calls the <span class="cmd">StartLiveCD</span>
script from the <span class="cmd">LiveCD</span> package. That script is responsible for
the rest of the initialization.
</p>

<h3>The SquashFS structure</h3> 
 
<p> The main LiveCD environment (i.e., the directory tree you see once 
the LiveCD booted) is stored as a series of SquashFS images. These 
images are built from two layers: one read-only layer that is the actual 
filesystem, (<span class="dir">Programs</span>, <span 
class="dir">Files</span>, <span class="dir">System</span>, etc.), and a 
read-write layer that sits on top for debugging purposes, containing 
assorted files that you may have created while logged in using <span 
class="cmd">ChrootEnvironment</span>. </p> 
 
<p> The main, first layer is generated at <span 
class="dir">Output/ROLayer</span>. This is built out of packages listed 
in <span class="dir">Archives/Packages</span> that are combined to build 
<span class="dir">/Programs</span>, additional files under <span 
class="dir">Archives/Ext</span> that are unpacked to their proper locations, 
plus a series of files and directories that are generated on-the-fly by 
the <span class="cmd">BuildRoot</span> script. <span 
class="cmd">BuildRoot</span> is called by <span 
class="cmd">CompressAndBuildISO</span> during the <span 
class="cmd">rolayer</span> step. </p> 
 
<p> Keep in mind that when you make modifications that alter the LiveCD 
environment itself, you need to regenerate the SquashFS image. To do 
this, pass an additional parameter to <i>CompressAndBuildISO</i>:  </p>

CompressAndBuildISO squashfs

<b>For GoboLinux devs</b>: To have your changes done permanently, you 
need to consult your changes in the <span class="dir">Output/RWLayer</span> and 
apply them to the relevant recipes which will generate new packages. 
 
<p> The package set for the CD is currently at the <span 
class="dir">livecd-packages</span> repository (see <span 
class="cmd">UpdateEnvironment</span> for details). When modifying the package 
set, you also need to update the <span  
class="dir">/Programs/BuildLiveCD/Current/Data/Packages-List-*</span> 
files. </p> 
 
After modifying packages, a full rebuild starting from <span 
class="cmd">rolayer</span> is needed to keep your <span 
class="dir">Output</span> directory in sync with the package repository:

CompressAndBuildISO rolayer
