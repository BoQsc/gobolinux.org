<h1>The Hall of Fame</h1>

<p>
Back in the early days, we made a list of the very first users of GoboLinux.
Many of them used it as their primary or only Linux distribution â€”
some still do! In keeping with the theme of the distribution,
with its octal version numbers, our "user numbers" were binary.
Some people even carried their user numbers in their
email signatures to show off their "pioneer status" <tt>:)</tt>.

We no longer maintain this "Hall of Fame", but it is fun to keep it around as a historical artifact. :)
