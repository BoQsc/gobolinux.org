<h1>Release images</h1>

<p>
The "release images" have become a little tradition in the GoboLinux world. Since 006 (when we started having a news section on the website), each announcement features a picture. Here they are, for your nostalgic pleasure!
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>GoboLinux 006</h2>

<p><i>
"This one was when we presented GoboLinux to the world. Nobody knew about us back then.
We posted the <a href="">Kuro5hin article</a> and it was picked up by every major
Linux-related news source. ISO downloads skyrocketed and the managers of the brazilian
internet backbone blocked our website twice. That night, we had some beers to
celebrate." -- Hisham Muhammad
</i></p>

<p><i>
The image is related to an internal joke of the GoboLinux team about our speculations
of how the world would react to our project: "GoboLinux!! Aaaaahhh!!!"... It was a
product of going to Google Image Search and typing the appropriate keyword: "fleeing".
</i></p>

<h3>It's official: GoboLinux 006 is out!</h3>
<p><i>May, 9th, 2003 at 1:05</i></p>
<p><img align="right" src="<<root>>/images/fleeing.gif" hspace="8px" vspace="4px">
Five months after the first alpha version, GoboLinux version 006 is now the official
stable release. There are too many improvements to list here, the greatest ones being
/System/Links/Shared, FiboSandbox, and last but never the least, GoboHide. As usual,
the ISO is compiled for i686 and is a "live CD" so you can try out GoboLinux without
actually installing it, so you have no reason not to check it out. :)
</p><p>
Existing users don't need to reinstall from scratch (actually the idea is to never
have to reinstall from scratch!). An upgrade mini-HOWTO will soon be posted on our
mailing list.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>GoboLinux 007</h2>

<p><i>
One of the main reasons dots were dropped from the version numbers was to get this
version number (actually, it was because we couldn't settle on a proper dot placement,
so instead we decided to adopt the octal scheme to critique the concept of "dot
releases" and "version bumps" -- but you've got to admit that "version 007" sounds
cool ;) ). The image was designed by André Detsch.

<h3>GoboLinux 007 released</h3>
<p><i>October, 22th, 2003 at 11:31</i></p>
<p>

<img align="left" src="<<root>>/images/007release.jpg" hspace="8px" vspace="4px">

After some weeks of intensive work, GoboLinux 007 final is available for download
(<a href="">download it!</a>). Since 006, there were major improvements all over
the system, including the funcionality required to pack "Environment", "Daemons"
and "Default Settings" information within packages (using the "Resources" directory).
The LiveCD experience was also severely improved: now you can run even KDE and
OpenOffice without touching your hard disk. With the use of IsoLinux, most (maybe all)
of the compatibility problems experienced when trying to boot the 006 CD on certain
machines are solved. 
</p><p>
If you have a GoboLinux 006 running, you don't need to reinstall it. Use the
<a href="">GoboLinux006-007 conversion script</a> to turn your system fully
compatible with the new scripts and packages.

<h2>GoboLinux 010</h2>

<p><i>
For GoboLinux 010, we didn't add an image. Instead, the whole site layout was updated,
going from the slashdottish "black border around white content area" to a white layout
more focused on the GoboLinux colors (purple-blue-turquoise gradient) and graphic
identity, with hints of transparency here and there.

<h3>A new look to welcome GoboLinux 010</h3>
<p><i>Last updated: 2004-01-07 06:54</i></p>
<p>
A new look for a new era! GoboLinux 010 is out, with lots of improvements over 007.
Among the new features are: a new installer, hardware detection, new custom themes.
As usual, a number of packages were also upgraded.  Some mirrors are still picking
it up (check the updated list at the <a href="">downloads</a> page).

<h2>GoboLinux 011</h2>

<p><i>
GoboLinux 011 was launched to coincide with the V International Forum on Free Software,
which take place in June 2004 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Hisham designed a T-shirt to be 
sold at the event. He wanted a design that reminisced the World War II propaganda posters
(one of André's subjects of interest). The result was a vectorized mascot in a "We want
you" pose, and the line "GoboLinux - join the revolution". Rafael adapted it into the
release icon.

We are pleased to introduce <a href="">GoboLinux 011</a>, the new major release of
GoboLinux, the alternative Linux distribution. This release features the introduction
of <a href="">Compile</a>, a new source-based compilation system. Other distinctive
features are the switch to the kernel 2.6 series (2.4 still included), adoption of
the Xorg X11 server, and a large number of upgraded packages.

<h2>GoboLinux 012</h2>

<p><i>
For GoboLinux 012, the vectorized Que is featured again. André asked for
a suggestion for the release image, and Hisham said "I don't know, something that
took a long time but now is complete", in an allusion to the long delays in the
development of that particular release. André took matters with his own hands and
did the cool sith mascot. Nothing could be more apropriate, since GoboLinux 012
was released around the time Episode III came out, and indeed the Star Wars saga
took a long time to be done but was now complete.

<h3>GoboLinux 012</h3>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce <a href="">GoboLinux 012</a>, the new major release of
GoboLinux, the alternative Linux distribution. This release features the usual series
of application upgrades, and marks the transition from devfs and Kudzu to udev and
Hotplug, which should bring hardware detection up-to-date. It also features a number
of improvements in the management tools, particularly the integration of the graphical
management console <a href="">Manager</a>.

<h2>GoboLinux 013</h2>

<p><i>
Version 013 was almost released without an image, as it was late in the night while we tried to
match our self-imposed deadline and everyone was so tired. Also, the site was redesigned for this
release, like on 010, so we even had a suitable excuse. ;) But since we worked so hard to make
this release as complete as possible, such detail could not be left behind. So Hisham made a
sketch of the mascot in the style of the new icons of the website.

<h3>GoboLinux 013</h3>

<p><i>Last updated: 2006-11-02 10:45</i></p>

<p>
<img align="left" src="<<root>>/images/release013.png" hspace="8px" vspace="4px">

We are pleased to introduce <b>GoboLinux 013</b>, the new major release of GoboLinux,
the alternative Linux distribution. This release is the result of over an year of work
on the build infrastructure used by the distribution. The new Live CD build environment
is highly customizable and package building was overhauled by using a dynamically-generated
sandboxed environment which insulates the source code and its dependencies during
compilation. 
</p>
<p>
These under-the-hood improvements resulted in cleaner builds when bringing the package
set up-to-date: major upgrades include Xorg 7.1, KDE 3.5.3, Glibc 2.4 and GCC 4.1.1.
This release also features a number of improvements in the management tools, particularly
new versions of <a href="">Manager</a>, the graphical management console, and 
<a href="">Compile</a>, the GoboLinux package building tool.

<h2>GoboLinux 014</h2>

<p><i>
Another release that took way too long. We were determined that this would be the last time we
would have such a long release cycle, and that we would at the very least reach the deadline of
releasing it in 2007. And, with much blood, sweat and tears, we did it. :-)

<h3>GoboLinux 014</h3>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce <a href="">GoboLinux 014</a>, the new major release of GoboLinux, the Linux distribution with an alternative directory structure. Major upgrades include KDE 3.5.8, Glibc 2.5 and Xorg 7.2, as well as new versions of the GoboLinux management tools.

Thanks to everybody who contributed by testing the development snapshots, submitting bug reports, fixing bugs, writing recipes...
</p><p>
...and a happy new year to everyone! :-)

<h2>GoboLinux 014.1</h2>

<p><i>
Our first "point" release. We knew we didn't have the time to make a full release that year,
but we wanted to get a release out of the door. So we planned to make a minor upgrade.
In the end, even that ended up taking a lot of work!

<h3>GoboLinux 014.1</h3>

<a href="images/cover01401.png"><img align="left" src="<<root>>/images/cover01401small.png" hspace="12px" vspace="6px"></a>

We are very happy to introduce GoboLinux 014.01, the new release of GoboLinux, the Linux distribution with an alternative file system structure. This release is our first "point release", providing a stability update for our latest major release, GoboLinux 014, which was released three months ago.
</p>
<p>
Read the detailed <a href="?page=release_notes_014.01">release notes</a> for more information and the full list of packages, including a list of which packages have changed from 014 to 014.01.
</p>
<p>
Once again, thanks to everybody who contributed with feedback, bug reports, bug fixes, recipes, translations...

<h2>GoboLinux 015</h2>

<p><i>
Well, if we thought that the previous releases took "too long", well this one is almost a
reboot of the project. The project was never really dead since many of us kept using 
it as our main production systems non-stop during this period.
</i></p>
<p><i>
We had major plans for GoboLinux 015, where we wished to fix a 
number of design issues that we identified over the years — the central idea would be 
the conversion from the /System/Links tree to the /System/Index tree, with greater
Unix compatibility. We were almost there circa 2010, thanks to the 
efforts of Jonas Karlsson, but due to a number of reasons we never got around to polish
a user-friendly release as our previous ones. It was only in 2014, that we were
to get a new version out again, when Lucas Correia Villa Real almost singlehandedly
produced an updated release.
</i></p>

<h3>Introducing GoboLinux 015</h3>

<p><i>Last updated: 2014-05-07 20:02</i></p>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce GoboLinux 015, the new major release of GoboLinux, the
Linux distribution featuring a rethought file system structure. This is the first
full-system image release in a number of years, after a long period in which we
kept only updating <a href="http://recipes.gobolinux.org/">compilation recipes</a>.
Packages were built using both <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/">ALFS</a>
(Automated Linux from Scratch) and our custom dynamically-generated sandboxed
environment which insulates the source code and its dependencies during compilation.
Major upgrades include the Enlightenment 18 desktop and kernel version 3.14.2,
as well as new versions of the GoboLinux management tools. Please check the
<a href="?page=release_notes_015">Release Notes</a> for
details and download instructions.
