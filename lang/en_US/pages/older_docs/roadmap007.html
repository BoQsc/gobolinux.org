<h3>
Road to 007
</h3>

<p> GoboLinux 007 will not be a major departure from 006, but rather, a
gradual improvement. A GoboLinux 007 system should be equivalent to a
GoboLinux 006 system plus updated packages (especially system packages
like Scripts, BootScripts and GoboHide). For this reason, 007 should not
take very long -- our goal is July 2003. However, the actual release
date should not matter much to the GoboLinux users, because the
functionality changes will be gradually introduced in the various
releases of the system packages between 006 and 007 (which should happen
in a steady pace again, as we start another development cycle). </p>

<p> These are the major things we have in mind for 007, so they'll
be the first items we will be working on: </p>

<ul>

<li> <b>The Resources directory, as seen on the <a
href="index.php?page=todo">To-do list</a>.</b> This will improve usability of
packages a lot, storing environment variables and possibly post-install
scripts.

<li> <b>Fix all known bugs in the Scripts.</b> All known serious bugs
were fixed for 006, but the last few releases of the Scripts package up
to 006 changed a lot of things, and the cleanup process is still not
complete. For this reason, a few bugs are still around.

<li> <b>Improve the live CD experience.</b> The base set of the 006 live
CD and 006 fresh system are near the same; this should change. The live
CD should include, for example, XFree86.

</ul>

<p>
These are additional goals for version 007:
</p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Improve the collection of packages.</b> The package collection
for 006 was rushed, and many popular packages ended up being left
out. The 007 ISO should have a much better selection, properly
discussed in the mailing list to match the needs of the userbase.

<li> <b>Automate the base system build process.</b> This is the first
step of a long term project, actually. Initially, this will serve to
avoid duplication of effort between the i386 and i686 ports. The long
term goal is to have a flexible build system that can be used in very
different enviornments: vanilla i686 builds for the CD, rootless
configurations, or even on top of other kernels.

<li> <b>Add some hardware detection on installation.</b> there are many
projects we can draw technology from in order to do this, so, while it
does give great benefits, it's not actually a big challenge.

<li> <b>Improve documentation.</b> A goal is to bundle as much docs as
we can. Documentation has progressed slowly, mostly because of the
frequent changes of the system. As things tend to stabilize now, 
the documentation should catch on.

</ul>

<h3>
The i386 port
</h3>

<p>
GoboLinux 006 is currently i686-only. Work on a i386 port has already
begun. The first step is a port of the 006 base packages, but the
end goal is to have ISOs of 007 for i686 and i386. While the set of
i386 packages will probably be made available before 007 is out,
I'd say that chances for a 006 release for i386 are low.
