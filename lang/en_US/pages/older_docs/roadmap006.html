<h2>To-do List</h2>

<p> Here's a list of things we plan for the future. These are <b>not</b>
"promised features", and they are in various stages of
completion/design, and those are listed <i>in no particular order</i>.
This is kept here, first and foremost, for our own control. Think of it
as a place to centralize the good ideas that pop up on the GoboLinux
mailing list. </p>

<ul>

<li> Improve name capitalization with a dictionary of exceptions,
     as suggested <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/comments/2003/5/9/05015/62649/174#174">here</a>.

<li> Make scripts check on the availability of tools they need
(for example, make the PlayVideo wrapper check for mplayer).
This is kinda trivial to implement, but there should be a unified
method to do this, so that all scripts make use of it.

<li> Programs/App/1.0/Resources - a directory to hold things such as:

     <ul>
     <li> /Programs/App/1.0/Resources/Environment - environment variables
          and aliases needed by the application.
     <li> /Programs/App/1.0/Resources/Dependencies - our .dependencies
          file should move here.
     <li> /Programs/App/1.0/Resources/Wrappers - convenience scripts
          created for GoboLinux (former app-dependant scripts in the
          Scripts packages). For example:
          /Programs/MPlayer/Current/Resources/Wrappers/PlayVideo
     <li> /Programs/App/1.0/Resources/Icon - who knows? Maybe one day
          we could implement a menu-management system.
     </ul>

<li> Allow the package installation scripts to download stuff. Packages
     which depend on other packages could download them from gobolinux.org
     or other user-specified mirrors. Source packages could download the
     source .tar.gz file from the app's original site.

<li> Update Rootless to "006ify it" (update it to use /S/L/Shared), and
     make the Scripts package fully-Rootless-compatible again.

<li> Remove archive management scripts from the Scripts package.
     Use atool (or a similar project) instead.

<li> Separate the "base set" into two sets: the set of programs to
     be copied to a freshly installed system, and the set of programs
     to be available in the live ISO.

<li> Improve documentation on installation, especially boot loader 
     stuff.

<li> Add proper SCSI support on the CD.

<li> Dependencies of Python packages could be detected searching for
     "import" lines in .py files with a rather small amount of parsing.
</ul>
