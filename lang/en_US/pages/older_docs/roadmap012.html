<h3>
Road to 012
</h3>

<p>
Another version, another roadmap. We took a long time
to write this one, which ended up delaying its release
time after time after time. I usually like to take this
space to write some looking-back review of the development
of the project (release milestones are always a good moment
for that), but I feel I just can't delay this roadmap any
longer. On the bright side, this roadmap was more collaboratively
written than any of the previous ones. :) 
</p>

<p>
Having said that, I feel the next release will be a turning point
in terms of user experience, even if there are no big architectural
changes. And the reason of that is Manager, Andr&eacute;'s graphical
frontend for Compile and Scripts.
Another big change is that GoboLinux 012 might mark the end of an
era. It is consensus among the GoboLinux team that the project
needs to enter a new stage. We'll need some changes in the way
the overall project is handled, which mean gradually adopting more
of a "bazaar" model -- developments like Compile give us a way to
decentralize the development in a structured, documented manner.
No set decisions were made yet -- only general ideas sketched --
but discussions should following in the mailing list. On the 
bright side, the end of an era is the beginning of another. :)
</p>

<p>
Well, so it turns out I managed to write my usual bit of blurb.
Enough of it, on to the features!
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Upgrade milestones.</b> KDE 3.3, Qt 3.3.3, GCC 3.4.x (whatever is latest --
will someone please stop those guys from releasing versions?)
</li>
<li>
<b>Kernel 2.6.x by default.</b> Including integration of UDEV. Probably a 2.4.x 
kernel will not be shipped within the installation CD, but a precompilled image 
will still be available for download at the site.
</li>
<li>
<b>Integration of Manager.</b> Manager is a graphical front-end
that makes easier to manage the packages from a GoboLinux system. 
012 version will feature a stable and feature-complete version of Manager.
</li>
<li>
<b>New Compile version.</b> Including: Minor changes on the user-interaction code, 
that enable easy integration with front-ends; Better support for systems without 
Internet access; General improvements and fixes, specially regarding the use of 
'NewVersion'; Better modularity, specially regarding Recipes finding and fetching.
Compile 2 dreams (currently in a -- very advanced I must say -- planning stage)
are post-012 material.
</li>
<li>
<b>SquashFS.</b> In replacement to cloop, SquashFS will be used to compress the 
data from the GoboLinux ISO. SquashFS provides (slighty) better compress ratios, 
much faster compression (requiring much less memory than cloop's compression)
and same performance as cloop while reading compressed data.

</li>
<li>
<b>Improved hardware detection.</b> No major changes, but the hardware database used
by the detection tools will be brought up-to-date.
</li>
<li>
<b>Selectable superuser name.</b> Set during installation process. Yes, "root" by default.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some things from the 011 roadmap still hold true as to-do work:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>New bootscripts.</b> (I promise they're coming this time!) They are
going to be as simple as the current ones, but more modular than the
current ones. While some scenarios need extra complexity (daemon
management, dependency-based boot) others just need a few programs
to be launched in a certain order at startup and "that's it". We
believe it is possible to support both in an elegant manner. And
do all of this in a themeable way, of course. ;-) 
</li>
<li>
<b>Improved shell agnosticism.</b> As zsh users, we don't like it when we are
forced into a bash-world. So, we won't try to force users of other
shells into a zsh-world, either. This means a change in the way
environment variables are handled, and the adoption of wrapper scripts
instead of shell functions and aliases whenever possible.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some things from the 007 roadmap still hold true as to-do work:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Automate the base system build process.</b> Compile already holds most if
not all of the recipes necessary to build the Base system, and we have a
mostly-automated build script to generate the ISO image, but we haven't
got to the point where we can shoot "go" in one end of the pipeline and
get a ready-to-ship ISO in the other end. I'd dare to say that by now we're
mostly comfortable with the level of automation we've got, but more is always
better.
</li>
<li>
<b>Improve the collection of packages.</b> This is an obvious, but tiring item,
which will always be on every roadmap. Ideally we want every package
shipped in the CD to be in its latest stable release, but situations like
Glibc compatibility are always complicated (especially when the devs say
things like <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2004-08/msg00002.html">here's
the latest release, but don't use it</a>).
</li>
<li>
<b>Improve documentation.</b> Documentation has improved slowly, and
not as steadily as we'd like. Help is greatly appreciated on this
regard.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
The i386 port
</h3>

<p>
There was considerable work on i386 since the last release, and as you can see
in the downloads page, we finally have a beta. It's not known at this stage
if 012 will come out in i686 and i386 flavors. Ultimately, I think demand
will dictate that. As far as I remember, there were not many (or any?) reports
on the mailing list about the i386 beta. Since the team is overloaded with
tasks (GoboLinux-related and otherwise), i386 is low-priority now. We keep
a working version because of the social project we're involved with, but I
personally don't know if a release-quality ISO (with live-CD GUI and other
fluff) is coming. [Disclaimer: I'm not the best person to talk about this
though, so if the other guys want to update this text, please feel free to
do so.] On the bright side, information regarding the status of the i386
port is now much more precise than it was in the previous roadmaps. :)
