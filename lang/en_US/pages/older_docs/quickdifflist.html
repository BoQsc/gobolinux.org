Differences between GoboLinux and a traditional Linux system
</h1>

<p>
  This is not a thorough description of GoboLinux, but a quick
  cheat-sheet of facts that are good to know when you are getting
  acquainted to the system.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
 In the GoboLinux hierarchy, files are grouped by their functional
  category (executables, libraries, and so on). There are links at the
  classic directories you are used to (/bin, /usr/bin, and so on), but 
  remember that they all point to the same place. This is a huge
  advantage, as it means, for example, that you'll never have to search
  for a library throughout your filesystem again -- it will always be in
  /lib (and in /usr/lib, because they point to the same place! -- no
  worries about compatibility).

<li>
 There are symbolic links relating most of the usual UNIX directories to
  the GoboLinux tree. Therefore, you will find directories such as /etc,
  /var/log and /usr/bin in the expected places. However, some directories,
  such as the users' directories, didn't need to be linked to their
  "legacy" locations. This way, for a given user called "joe", you'll
  have, instead of /home/joe, /Users/joe. Notice also that the superuser's
  directory is no different than the ones from the other users, so, root's
  directory is at /Users/root. Mount points are under /Mount, not /mnt.

<li>
 Another major difference between GoboLinux and most Linux distributions
  is that it does not use a BSD nor a System V initialization procedure.
  Instead, it has its own. At /System/Settings/BootScripts you will find
  a few files that command the entire boot procedure: BootUp and Shutdown run
  at system boot and shutdown, respectively; you can define custom "runlevel"
  scripts to define different ways you want your system to be initialized
  (say, Single and Multi for single and multi-user, Graphical for boot into
  graphic mode, etc.) and control that from the boot loader menu. 
  The /System/Settings/BootOptions file separate site-specific settings
  from the rest of the scripts. You can also find a library of application
  specific tasks at /System/Links/Tasks that can be used during boot
  (those are installed by the apps).
</ul>

<p>
  For a better overview of how it looks and
  feels night, nothing beats giving the Live CD a spin. You'll
  be running a full GoboLinux system without having to install
  anything. Just burn a CD-RW and give it a go!
