<h2>  
GoboLinux: what is it all about? 
</h2>  
  
<p><i>  
This page originally just contained a quick list of reminders for  
the users who installed GoboLinux (it was actually a HTML-ization  
of a textfile contained within the /Depot/Docs directory of the  
ISO). Since it is one-click away from Slashdot right now, I think  
people deserve a better introduction to what GoboLinux is all about.

<p>  
For those who are interested and would like a more complete  
introduction, I recommend the  <a  
href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/9/05015/62649">Kuro5hin article I posted</a>.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
Now, a quick overview.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
In GoboLinux, each program lives in its own directory, like this:  
</p>  
<pre>  
/Programs/Netkit-Base/0.17/bin/ping  
/Programs/LibPNG/1.2.5/lib/libpng.so.3  
(and so on)  
</pre>  
<p>  
For each category of files, there is a directory under <tt>/System/Links</tt>  
collecting symlinks of the programs' files.  
</p>  
<pre>  
/System/Links/Executables/ping  
/System/Links/Libraries/libpng.so.3  
(and so on)  
</pre>  
<p>  
Traditional Unix paths are also symlinks, to the <tt>/System/Links</tt>  
strucutre:  
</p>  
<pre>  
/bin -> /System/Links/Executables  
/usr/bin -> /System/Links/Executables  
/usr/lib -> /System/Links/Libraries  
(and so on)  
</pre>  
<p>  
This system provides many niceties: it makes it easy for different versions  
of libraries to coexist, it's easy to uninstall software compiled from  
source, and it does not require a database-oriented package management  
system. In case you're wondering, we do have a basic dependency tracking  
system going. Other unusual stuff: it doesn't use either SysV nor BSD  
bootscripts (in favor of a simpler, custom system); the default user #0  
is named "gobo" instead of "root" (just because -- you can set it to  
anything you like).  
</p>  
<p>  
The project is one-and-a-half year old, and it is on a quite usable  
state.
