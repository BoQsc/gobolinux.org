<h2>Organization: is there any?</h2>

<p><i>Hisham Muhammad</i>, November 13th, 2003.</p>

<h3>Who is who</h3>

<p>
There is no formal organization at this point. The way things work now are 
derived from the historical evolution of the project. I came up with the 
original idea, which Andr&eacute; and I first implemented. Guilherme joined soon 
thereafter. Lucas and Rafael followed.
</p><p>
The heart of the distribution is the Scripts package, for which I have been 
the gatekeeper for most of the time and will return to be soon.
</p><p>
Guilherme was the one who first put GoboLinux on a CD, and he takes care of 
that part to this day. I think he is the person who was most overloaded 
during my absence, and he did a wonderful job in keeping the ball running. 
Thanks again.
</p><p>
When Lucas came by, he asked "what can I do" and gladly accepted the kernel 
maintenance duties. Also, he and Felipe Damasio are the developers of 
GoboHide we all love. Ah, and he is the one you all vimsters have to thank 
for.
</p><p>
Rafael worked hard on the late source packages project (which was not in vain! 
I converted some of the scripts for inclusion in Compile and plan to convert 
more of them as time allows) and, with help from Lucas, was the first brave 
soul to attempt to compile GNOME for GoboLinux (that alone will guarantee his 
entrance to heaven, along with me and Stu Penrose). He is now temporarily 
retired from the project, dedicating himself to meditation and the search for 
his inner soul.
</p><p>
Andr&eacute;, the other co-founder, is a funny case, because everytime people ask me 
this I never know how to describe what he does in the project. At times I 
feel he has evaporated, but at other times, such as right now, he is 
essential (and I mean it). I guess his greatest assets are his personality 
traits. They balance the group well. In the early days, he was the main 
package builder (in megabytes, while I was the main package builder in 
package count, packing inumerous silly programs found on Freshmeat every week 
:) ), taking care of important stuff such as KDE, XFree86 and Glibc. 
</p><p>
These are the people who worked the most on the project, and the people I 
would list if I had to point out a "core team". I'll be honest here. The fact 
that all five of us are close friends (in real life, that is) and are or have 
been co-workers undeniably speeds up the process. There is hardly a way where 
outside contributors can interact with the development process as intimately. 
I see at least two or three of these guys every day in person. I hate to put 
people out of the loop, but sometimes it just happens that some decision is 
taken at a dinner table instead of in the mailing list.
</p><p>
Having said that, since the beginning, other people have helped in many ways.
</p><p>
Leandro Motta Barros, another friend of ours, started to work on a nice 
documentation project, which seems to be currently stalled (I can't blame him 
since some concepts in GoboLinux kept changing so fast during this year), and 
given the quality of what was produced so far, I'm happy to wait.
</p><p>
Dario Rodriguez was the first user from outside of Brazil, back in the 
pre-Slashdot days, and he was an invaluable source of bug reports and 
motivated us to write most of the documentation we currently have, because 
back then all GoboLinux knowledge was spread folklorically, by word of mouth. 
:)
</p><p>
Carlo Calica was the one who introduced us to runit, a major improvement in 
the distribution and contributed bug-fixes to the Scripts. Sarah Sholu 
started to write tools for interaction with Portage, during our brief affair 
with the Gentoo project, and also started an installer.
</p><p>
Many other people contributed compiled packages: Cadu Moreira, Ant&ocirc;nio Souto, 
Todd Boland, Giusepe Casagrande, Stu Penrose... Here's the point where I'll 
start to forget names and make injustices, sorry... as they say in the "80s 
hard rock albums thank-you lists": you know who you are! You all rock!
</p>

<h3>How to join</h3>

<p>
First of all, help is always welcome!
</p><p>
Because of the structure (or lack of) that I described above, it was always 
hard for people to just join in the project and start contributing. One 
problem, just as an example: how to accept binaries from someone who appears 
out of nowhere and says "nice project! here are some compiled packages"? That 
would be unresponsible. I believe this problem is now, if not solved, much 
relieved by the advent of the Compile system I posted this week. Anyone can 
contribute recipes. I would find it great if people volunteered to maintain 
certain recipes, too. Package availability and maintenance is the #1 problem 
in any distribution. This is the part that needs the most manpower (or is it 
personpower? or the 90s are over and we can forget about being collitically 
correct again?)
</p><p>
The other way I see how people can contribute is by taking a task that is 
totally "unassigned" (ie, that nobody's working on) and that can be done 
relatively independently and working on that. Leandro did this taking the 
documentation thing. Time and again people ask for GUI configuration tools 
and stuff like that. Those would be welcome additions. [ Side note: But I'm 
not sure how much of a job of the distro maker that is. I think it is our job 
to integrate them if the tools are available. For example, if you want to 
improve GoboLinux by writing an X configuration tool to do stuff such as 
setting refresh rate, resolution, etc., why don't you make it a general, 
non-distro-specific tool? That would be more useful. ]
</p><p>
Another thing I have done now and then that help us is to contribute 
'configure' scripts to the projects out there. Many times it doesn't even 
need to be a complex autoconf thing, sometimes a hand-written, single-screen 
shell script which merely sets one prefix variable in a Makefile is enough. A 
well behaved tarball is a GoboLinux source package. Making the world a more 
GoboLinux-friendly place is a Good Thing. 
</p><p>
In my view, core stuff such as the Scripts, release management and such will 
work better if they stay in the hands of the "core team" I listed above, at 
least for the time being. I'd understand if someone is disappointed in 
hearing me say (err, reading me write) this, but I don't think it is 
unreasonable.
</p>

<h3>Cool. But what are we working for, again?</h3>

<p>
Every person involved in any level to this project has their own views about 
this. If you ask my opinion, I'll say I wish GoboLinux to grow and become 
significant, because I believe that would improve the Linux world as whole, 
if only for removing hardcoded paths from everything. My ultimate goal, 
"where I see GoboLinux in 5 years or whatever", is to have a great <i>operating 
system</i>, not just a "cool Linux distro". It's no secret that I admire Apple 
Computer (my first computer was an Apple ][) and I envy Mac OS X. They gave 
UNIX a well-deserved kick in the butt, and I think projects such as ours here 
is a step in the right direction.
