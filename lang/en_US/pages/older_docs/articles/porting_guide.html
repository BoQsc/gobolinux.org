<h3>Quick-and-dirty GoboLinux Porting Guide</h3>

<p><i>Hisham Muhammad</i>, November 19th, 2003.</p>

<p>
Currently, GoboLinux is x86 only. Actually it is i686 only, though there is
a incomplete (the pretty word would be "domain-specific") i386 port.
Want to be the first to get GoboLinux to run in some other architecture?
I believe things will be easier if you follow the following "plan of attack".
Let's take the PowerPC architecture as an example.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
So, take a Linux PPC distribution, and install the bare minimum to be able to 
compile programs with it. You don't want programs to get any extra 
dependencies compiled in by accident. We want to build a Glibc 2.3/GCC 3.3 
based system here, so try to get a Linux PPC distro which supports those or 
upgrade them to these version using the means provided by your distribution, 
or simply, by hand (you'll nuke the distro in the end, anyway).
</li>

<li>
Then, create GoboLinux-like directories on it: /Programs, /System, etc. In the 
unlikely event that you don't have any x86 system around, we can provide you 
any necessary information about how GoboLinux looks like. ;) 
</li>

<li>
Now, get the latest GoboLinux Scripts package from gobolinux.org and
unpack it at <tt>/Programs</tt>.
You should now have <tt>/Programs/Scripts/(date)</tt> files. You may need to 
copy files from <tt>Scripts/20031115-hisham/Resources/Defaults/Settings</tt> to 
<tt>/Programs/Scripts/Settings</tt>. Go to <tt>/System/Links/Executables</tt>, 
<tt>/System/Settings</tt>, and friends and symlink stuff by hand. 
</li>

<li>
Add <tt>/System/Links/Executables</tt> to your PATH, <tt>/System/Links/Libraries</tt> to your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and so on. Having an x86 GoboLinux handy will surely help so 
you can look at it and compare. Put GoboLinux stuff first so that they will 
gradually override your old Linux distro. You may have trouble with <tt>/etc</tt> vs. 
<tt>/System/Settings</tt>, because unlike executables, libraries and headers, there is 
no environment variable for this. Do this, then: move <tt>/etc</tt> to <tt>/etc-old</tt>, link 
everything from <tt>/etc-old</tt> inside <tt>/System/Settings</tt>, and make <tt>/etc</tt> point to 
<tt>/System/Settings</tt>.
</li>

<li>
I don't remember now if there is any essential GoboLinux script that is 
written in a compiled language. Let's check this, just a sec... oh, just one: 
RealPath. That's a trivial C program that just calls realpath(3). The sources 
are not here at my computer right now... who has it?
</li>

<li>
Ok, so by now you can theoretically run CompilePackage and stuff like that. 
Let's take a small program for a test run. Get this:
<a href="ftp://ftp.gw.com/mirrors/pub/unix/file/file-4.04.tar.gz">
ftp://ftp.gw.com/mirrors/pub/unix/file/file-4.04.tar.gz
</a>
and try to: <tt>CompileProgram file-4.04.tar.gz</tt>
If it does compile, and in the end you get something like 
<tt>/Programs/File/4.04/bin/file</tt>, then we're almost there.
</li>

<li>
The Compile package which contains automated compilation rules is included
with the system. 
Now, go following the list of packages from 
<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/cvs/">
Linux from Scratch</a>.
You want the list from Part III, Chapter 6. Feel free (and encouraged) to skip 
some critical and error-prone packages like Glibc, Binutils, GCC and Ncurses 
at first. (Actually, I think I don't have Recipes for Glibc and GCC yet -- 
there are GoboLinux source packages for those somewhere, I'll build Recipes 
based on those). By the time you're finished here we expect to have all 
Recipes necessary to build Base done, so let's assume you'll be able to 
compile the entire Base this way. Start with "Compile Man-Pages" and go on 
from there.
</li>

<li>
Now, what do we need to get a complete system? Let's think...
Get a BootScripts package from the website. It's just shell scripts, so they 
should be portable. InstallPackage it normally.
Check in a GoboLinux x86 system which non-link files should be present at 
<tt>/System/Settings</tt>. Off the top of my head, there are passwd, group, inittab, 
fstab... There are more, that's something to be checked.
Well, you need also a kernel and its modules at <tt>/System/Kernel/Boot</tt> and 
<tt>/System/Kernel/Modules</tt> (symlink stuff at <tt>/lib/modules</tt>). Take your running 
distro's kernel and modules, let's reduce potential sources of problems. 
Later on you can compile a kernel with GoboHide and other goodies.
</li>

<li>
Well, that's it. Set up your favorite bootloader and voil&agrave;! There you have 
your GoboLinux PPC system. It's a whole lot of work, but it is doable, 
especially given that we have "been there and done that" and can help you 
should problems arise. Just keep a rescue disk handy because you'll probably 
render your system unbootable a few times during the process. :)
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Whoa!
</p><p>
We didn't even get to ten. I'm sure I forgot one thing or another, but I 
believe I got the most important parts covered. So there you have it: 
"GoboLinux Porting Guide version 0.0.0.0.0.0.1" :) I'm very enthusiastic 
about the idea of porting GoboLinux to non-x86 architectures. Fernando Massen 
and I toyed with the idea once, but we tried to do this on top of Mac OSX, 
which is a bad idea because it is based on a BSD userland and GoboLinux 
assumes a GNU userland. We got as far as getting a few packages compiled... 
CoreUtils--5.0--G4.tar.bz2, if I recall correctly, but Massen lost interest 
in the project shortly after. Using a Linux PPC system should reduce much of 
the hassle. If it was doable on top of OS X, it's certainly doable on top of 
a Linux PPC distro, and I believe the same is true for other architectures.

Have fun and feel free to ask any questions on the list!
