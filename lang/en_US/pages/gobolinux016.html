<h1>Introducing GoboLinux 016</h1>

<h2>An exercise in distro design</h2>

<p>GoboLinux was created out of a desire to try new approaches in the
Linux distribution design space: the <a href="?page=at_a_glance">innovative
filesystem organization</a> allows us to use a radically different 
approach in package management — effectively doing away with
the package manager.</p>

<p>GoboLinux 016 continues this journey, with a focus on the exploration of novel ideas
aiming to make the system simpler yet functional.</p>

<h2>Runner: container-free filesystem virtualization</h2>

<p>
<b>Runner</b> is a brand new filesystem virtualization tool, specifically
designed for GoboLinux. It dynamically changes a process' view of <tt>/System/Index</tt>
based on the program's <tt>Dependencies</tt> file.
</p>

<p>From day one, GoboLinux has always supported keeping multiple versions of a
program installed on disk at the same time, but when two versions had
conflicts, you had to choose which one would be activated in the system as the
default.</p>

<p> With Runner, you don't need to worry about which version of a given
dependency is currently linked (or activated) in <tt>/System/Index</tt>: Runner gives
the process its own virtual <tt>/System/Index</tt> with all the right dependencies.
</p>

<h3>Avoiding conflicts without containers</h3>

<p>
Instead of using full-fledged containers (which carry an entire distro
inside them!) just to avoid library conflicts when running an executable,
in GoboLinux you can launch a program with Runner to make sure the
filesystem view of the process will match its dependencies. 
Runner builds a custom mount table for the process, like container tools
do, but without all the file duplication: it dynamically picks the
correct parts of your <tt>/Programs</tt> tree. This approach is only feasible
because in GoboLinux programs are logically organized in the filesystem.
</p>

<h3>A transparent multi-arch setup</h3>

<p>
Unlike mainstream distributions, GoboLinux doesn't need a particular "multi-arch"
setup for supporting 32 and 64-bit binaries. Using Runner, we can simply
give 32-bit processes their own view of the standard Unix directories so that,
for example, <tt>/lib/libc.so.6</tt> is a 32-bit library for a 32-bit process
and a 64-bit library for a 64-bit process.

<h2>GoboNet: daemon-free wireless network management</h2>

<p>
This release includes <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/GoboNet">GoboNet</a>,
our own daemon-free network manager. Feature-heavy network managers like Wicd and
NetworkManager are great at handling numerous complex scenarios, but the vast
majority of the time something much simpler would do. And when the network
manager does not suit your needs, it is important that it does not get in the way.
</p>

<p>
GoboNet is a simple wireless networking tool that "just works" in the common
case and doesn't get in the way when you need to tweak things yourself.
It does not use DBus or any daemon of its own: it only launches <tt>dhcpcd</tt>
to handle DHCP, manages Wi-Fi passwords and provides a command-line API
for ease of use and scripting.

<h2>An Awesome desktop</h2>

<p>GoboLinux 016 features a minimalistic yet comfortable desktop based on the
Awesome window manager. Awesome is well-known as an excellent tiling WM, but
its Lua scripting capabilities makes it extremely customizable. In Gobo, we
tuned it so it ships with a setup based on floating windows which should be
familiar to all users, while keeping all the power features of Awesome at
hand. </p>

<h3>Custom widgets</h3>

<p>We also developed custom Awesome widgets that integrate nicely with the
no-frills philosophy of Gobo:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Wi-Fi widget uses <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/GoboNet">GoboNet</a></li></li>
<li>The battery widget checks the sysfs filesystem</li>
<li>Our custom audio widget launches a transient frameless terminal running an instance of AlsaMixer that can be controlled via keyboard or mouse</li>
</ul>

<p>
And just like the background of this website,
the wallpaper is procedurally-generated — you get a new one on every boot. :)
