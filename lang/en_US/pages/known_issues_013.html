<h3>SMP problems with SquashFS</h3>

<p>
There seems to be a bug on SquashFS affecting <b>SMP</b>/<b>HyperThreaded</b> systems.
If you see SquashFS-related errors when booting or running the Live CD, you can either
disable SMP/HT on your BIOS while running the Live CD or disable them in the kernel,
passing the following command at the CD bootloader prompt:
</p>

<pre>
/isolinux/kernel initrd=initrd init=/linuxrc ramdisk_size=4096 root=/dev/ram0 video=vesafb:off ide=nodma Boot=LiveCD
</pre>

<p>
Dual core AM2 AMD64 systems are also known to be defective, and can be booted fine after 
supplying the following command instead:
</p>
<pre>
/isolinux/kernel initrd=initrd init=/linuxrc ramdisk_size=4096 root=/dev/ram0 video=vesafb:off noapic nolapic nosmp apic=off Boot=LiveCD
</pre>

<p>
This problem does not affect the installed system, which works with SMP/HT/AM2 fine.
</p>

<h3>QEmu with KQEmu</h3>

<p>
If you're getting "Lost interrupt" errors when booting the ISO with QEmu, try disabling
the KQEmu kernel module, with <tt>rmmod kqemu</tt>. (This is probably a bug in KQEmu.)
</p>

<h3>Booting problems on VMware</h3>
<p>
If you get an error message like this:
<pre>
VFS Cannot open root device "sda1"
</pre>
then it's possible that VMware is configured to emulate a "LSI Logic" SCSI adapter.
To fix that, just modify your virtual machine so that it emulates the "BusLogic" SCSI 
adapter or an IDE drive and the problem will go away.
</p>
<p>
Also, X11 detection is known not to work with VMware. You can still launch X11 using
the default VESA configuration, but you need to skip X11 detection by pressing Esc
when you see the "X11 detection" message during boot.
