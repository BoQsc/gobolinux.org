<h1>Runner: container-free filesystem virtualization</h1>

<img class="home_icon right_icon" src="<<root>>/images/icon_runner.svg">

<p>
<b>Runner</b> is a brand new filesystem virtualization tool, specifically
designed for GoboLinux. It dynamically changes a process' view of <tt>/System/Index</tt>
based on the program's <tt>Dependencies</tt> file.
</p>

<p>From day one, GoboLinux has always supported keeping multiple versions of a
program installed on disk at the same time, but when two versions had
conflicts, you had to choose which one would be activated in the system as the
default.</p>

<p> With Runner, you don't need to worry about which version of a given
dependency is currently linked (or activated) in <tt>/System/Index</tt>: Runner gives
the process its own virtual <tt>/System/Index</tt> with all the right dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Avoiding conflicts without containers</h2>

<p>
Instead of using full-fledged containers (which carry an entire distro
inside them!) just to avoid library conflicts when running an executable,
in GoboLinux you can launch a program with Runner to make sure the
filesystem view of the process will match its dependencies. 
Runner builds a custom mount table for the process, like container tools
do, but without all the file duplication: it dynamically picks the
correct parts of your <tt>/Programs</tt> tree. This approach is only feasible
because in GoboLinux programs are logically organized in the filesystem.
</p>

<h2>A transparent multi-arch setup</h2>

<p>
Unlike mainstream distributions, GoboLinux doesn't need a particular "multi-arch"
setup for supporting 32 and 64-bit binaries. Using Runner, we can simply
give 32-bit processes their own view of the standard Unix directories so that,
for example, <tt>/lib/libc.so.6</tt> is a 32-bit library for a 32-bit process
and a 64-bit library for a 64-bit process.
