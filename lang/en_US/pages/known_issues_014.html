<h2>AM2 problems with SquashFS</h2>

<p>
There seems to be a bug on SquashFS affecting <b>Dual core AM2 AMD64 systems</b>. These system boots after 
supplying the following command at the CD bootloader prompt:
</p>
<pre>
/isolinux/kernel initrd=initrd init=/linuxrc ramdisk_size=4096 root=/dev/ram0 video=vesafb:off noapic nolapic nosmp apic=off Boot=LiveCD max_loop=32
</pre>

<p>
This problem does not affect the installed system, which works with SMP/HT/AM2 fine.
</p>

<h2>Other issues</h2>

<p>
The LiveCD is known to have problems booting on the VirtualBox OSE emulator. This has been 
fixed in the in-development version of the distribution.
