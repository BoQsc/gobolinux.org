<h1>
Gobolinux 013 - Release Notes
</h1>

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce <b>GoboLinux 013</b>, the new major release of
GoboLinux, the alternative Linux distribution. This release is the
result of over an year of work on the build infrastructure used by
the distribution. The new Live CD build environment is highly
<a href="?page=livecd">customizable</a> and package building was overhauled
by using a dynamically-generated sandboxed environment which insulates
the source code and its dependencies during compilation.
</p><p>
These under-the-hood improvements resulted in cleaner builds when
bringing the package set up-to-date: major upgrades include Xorg 7.1,
KDE 3.5.3, Glibc 2.4 and GCC 4.1.1. This release also features a number
of improvements in the management tools, particularly new versions of <a href="?page=manager">Manager</a>, the graphical management console, and
<a href="?page=compile">Compile</a>, the GoboLinux package building tool.
</p>

<h2> Availability </h2>

<p>
GoboLinux is available as an ISO download, in a number of
<a href="?page=downloads">mirrors</a>.
</p>

<h2> Overview of this release </h2>

<h3> Live CD </h3>

<p>
The GoboLinux CD serves both as an installation disc and a Live CD, with a complete graphical desktop featuring KDE 3.5.3, OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 and a host of applications. In fact, due to the modular nature of the GoboLinux filesystem, every program available in the CD can be used directly from the "live" environment -- the work of the installer is to simply copy the user's selection to the destination partition (respecting dependency chains).
</p>

<h3> Graphical installer </h3>

<p>
Since version 010, GoboLinux features an installer that works on both text and graphical mode. The feature set of both modes is identical, thanks to the innovative <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/abstk">AbsTK</a> (Abstract Toolkit), created by the GoboLinux team especially for this installer: a unified widget toolkit for Python which detects and adapts itself for different environments. It currently supports two backends: ncurses/console and Qt/X11.
</p>

<h3> Hardware detection </h3>

<p>
GoboLinux features a Udev-based hardware detection system. A large number of devices are detected, loading the appropriate kernel modules.
</p>

<p>
Video detection is performed separately, by Xorg's own autodetection mechanism. If for any reason video card detection fails while booting the Live CD, you can skip to the default, "vesa", which works for most cards (unaccelerated).
</p>

<h2> Changes since GoboLinux 012 </h2>

<h3> UnionFS-based Live CD </h3>

<p>
The entire Live CD environment is now writable, by layering a
RAM-disk on top of the root directory. This way, not only
settings can be edited, but even packages can be downloaded from the
net and installed directly on the Live CD environment.
</p>

<h3> Modular SquashFS </h3>

<p>
The GoboLinux LiveCD is now built as a series of SquashFS images
which are merged using UnionFS. This brings greater flexibility
when customizing the CD, as packages from the base system can be
easily separated from desktop applications, and additional
SquashFS can be added or replaced with ease.
</p>

<h3> Enhancements in management scripts </h3>

<p>
The new versions of the GoboLinux management scripts include
a large number of new features, including support for package
signatures, automated management of configuration upgrades,
and a new dependencies format.
</p>

<h3> Built using ChrootCompile </h3>

<p>
Virtually all packages (with the notable exceptions of
OpenOffice.org, Firefox and Thunderbird, which are packed
from their official binary builds) were built from source
using <a href="?page=chrootcompile">ChrootCompile</a>, a new tool developed by the GoboLinux
team that provides a dynamically-generated sandboxed environment,
insulating the source code and its dependencies during compilation.
</p>

<h3> Listener </h3>

<p>
GoboLinux now includes a tool for listening on filesystem events
and assigning actions to be performed automatically, aptly named
Listener. With it, you can, for example, clean up the links
tree automatically as packages are removed from /Programs.
</p>

<h2> Hardware requirements </h2>

<h3> Processor </h3>

<p>
GoboLinux is compiled to run on i686-class systems: Intel Pentium II/III/4, Intel Celeron, AMD Duron, AMD Athlon/XP/MP.
</p>

<h3> Memory </h3>

<p>
To load the Live CD environment, 32 MB of RAM is the recommended minimum for a text-mode install, 64 MB is the recommended minimum to load the graphic KDE desktop; 128 MB is recommended for a comfortable Live CD experience.
</p>
<p>
Once the system is installed in the hard disk, memory requirements vary greatly depending on the kind of applications executed, but the values stated above related to the Live CD experience serve as a good guideline.
</p>

<h3> Video and peripherals </h3>

<p>
Video cards are supported through the Xorg X11 server, with the fallback "vesa" driver covering the vast majority of current cards. A large number of sound cards are supported through ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) and OSS (Open Sound System). Other peripherals are supported through additional packages (CUPS, SANE, GPhoto, etc.) available in the GoboLinux repository and recipe store.
</p>

<h2> Package-specific notes </h2>

<p>
This section contains some general comments about the package set included in GoboLinux. The complete list of packages included in the CD follows in the next section.
</p>

<h3> Absence of proprietary packages </h3>

<p>
This release does not include any proprietary packages. It is worth to point out that programs such as Sun JDK and Macromedia Flash do work under GoboLinux with no limitations -- they are not included for legal reasons only. As alternatives to Acrobat Reader, we recommend Kpdf and Xpdf.
</p>

<h3> Internationalization </h3>

GoboLinux ships whenever possible all packages distributed in their original state, as intended by the authors of the various free software projects that compose the distribution. This also applies to the distribution of the locale files. Therefore, support for internationalization varies according to the translation status of each project for each language. External locale packages are not usually included in the CD, but due to user demand, Brazilian Portuguese and German i18n packages for KDE are shipped.

<h3> About GoboLinux </h3>
<p>
GoboLinux is a Linux distribution created in 2002 which implements an
innovative approach in terms of system administration. It defines a
new directory hierarchy which allows the coherent management of the
installed base of programs from a system. This is done exclusively
through the filesystem layout, without relying on databases or
package managers.
</p>
<p>
In GoboLinux, each program resides in its own directory, such as
/Programs/Xorg/7.1 and /Programs/KDE/3.5.3. Each file category
(executables, libraries, headers) can also be accessed through unified
symlink views, such as /System/Links/Libraries and
/System/Links/Headers. These views match the legacy directories (/bin,
/usr/include, /usr/local/share, and so on), achieving total Unix
compatibility while keeping program directories completely
self-contained.
