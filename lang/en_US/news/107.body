The next release of GoboLinux is under active development. As in the last release, we are using <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/GoboALFS">GoboALFS</a>, a collection of build scripts based on <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/">Automated Linux From Scratch</a> and our own <a href="http://recipes.gobolinux.org">Compile recipes tree</a>. The main focus of this next release is designing a very lean core system with updated packages, including 64-bit support.
