Zoltán Viola contacted us to announce a new website created by the Hungarian community of GoboLinux users: <a href="http://www.gobolinux.info">gobolinux.info</a>, featuring a wiki and forums. Zoltán also pointed us to a free e-book on GoboLinux he wrote, licensed under a Creative Commons license and available in PDF <a href="http://mek.oszk.hu/05800/05895/">here (in Hungarian)</a>. Impressive work!
