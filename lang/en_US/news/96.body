<p>
The main gobolinux.org website is now back up, after being taken down for inspection
once a security breach was detected. All main services provided by the website
should be up again by now, except for a few administrative features. Sorry about
the inconvenience and thanks to everyone who worked on getting things back on track.
If anything is still broken, be sure to let us know through the <a href="http://lists.gobolinux.org/mailman/listinfo/gobolinux-devel">mailing lists</a>.
