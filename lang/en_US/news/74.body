After a brief testing period, we are now ready to announce our new <a href="http://forum.gobolinux.org">online 
forum</a>. This is a new space for GoboLinux users to discuss the distro, share tips and help each other. Feel free to 
join in at <a href="http://forum.gobolinux.org">forum.gobolinux.org</a>. Thanks to Michael Homer for hosting and 
setting up the new forum. We'd also like to extend our thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://
www.pakistanopensource.org">PakistanOpenSource</a> for their time hosting the old forum.
