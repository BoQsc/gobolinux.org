We are pleased to introduce GoboLinux 015, the new major release of GoboLinux, the Linux distribution featuring a rethought file system structure. This is the first full-system image release in a number of years, after a long period in which we kept only updating <a href="http://recipes.gobolinux.org/">compilation recipes</a>. Packages were built using both <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/">ALFS</a> (Automated Linux from Scratch) and our custom dynamically-generated sandboxed environment which insulates the source code and its dependencies during compilation. Major upgrades include the Enlightenment 18 desktop and kernel version 3.14.2, as well as new versions of the GoboLinux management tools. Please check the <a href="?page=release_notes_015">Release Notes</a> for details and download instructions.
