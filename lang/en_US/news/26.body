A new look for a new era! GoboLinux 010 is out, with lots of
improvements over 007. Among the new features are: a new installer,
hardware detection, new custom themes. As usual, a number of packages
were also upgraded. <!-- GoboLinux 010 features software such as KDE 3.2.1,
GCC 3.2.2 and Linux 2.4.22. --> Some mirrors are still picking it up (check
the updated list at the <a href="?page=downloads">downloads</a>
page).
