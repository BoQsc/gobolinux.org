GoboLinux now has a community space in the web: the
<a href="http://gobolinux.org/kb">GoboLinux Knowledge Base</a>
is a <a href="http://gobolinux.org/kb/index.php/WikiWikiWeb">wiki</a>
where users and developers can share thoughts and information
in a "less transient" way than in the mailing list. Check it out,
enjoy, and contribute. Ultimately, how this space will end up being
used is up to you. :)
