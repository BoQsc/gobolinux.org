GoboLinux is all about cool ideas. A lot of them float around
in the mailing list, but end up buried in the archives. Now
gobolinux.org has a place to store them, with an optimistic
name of <a href="?page=todo">To-do List</a>. It is part 
of the <a href="?page=documentation">documentation</a>
section.
