This year's <a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org">International Forum on Free Software</a> (Porto Alegre, Brazil, April 17-19 2008) will feature GoboLinux challenges as the entry point to their <a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/9.0/www/arena">Programming Arena contest</a>. The challenges were taken from the bug tracker and represent real bugs or desired features. We'd like to thank all participants in advance and wish them all good luck!
