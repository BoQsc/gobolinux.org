<p>
Many posts from the mailing list provide valuable information,
but usually they end up buried in the list archives.
To solve this problem, a new section was added to the
<a href="index.php?page=documentation">Documentation</a>
page, featuring those messages from the
GoboLinux developers, formatted as informal articles. Three
articles from the past month were added, and new ones are
expected to pop up there from time to time.
