One week late and not with all promissed features, the 007beta
was released. The missing feature is the hardware detection; it is a work in
progress, and we expect that it will be ready for the 007gamma release.
This release only contains the Base System. The live CD now uses the cloop module from
knoppix, and the installation process was improved, supporting profiles.
