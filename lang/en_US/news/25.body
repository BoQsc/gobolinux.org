Thanks to our admin Ricardo Sanchez, GoboLinux now offers
rsync access to its mirrors. The address is cscience.org::gobolinux-iso.
For regular downloads, we still recommend using one of our mirrors,
since our server has low bandwidth and more often than not is heavily
loaded. If you'd like to provide a mirror for the GoboLinux ISO, don't
hesitate in contacting us, and we'll happily list you in the downloads page.
