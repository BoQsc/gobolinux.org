It's always a happy time when we announce a new language available in
gobolinux.org!
Thanks to the contributions of Zolt√°n Viola, we now feature Hungarian
in the language selection.

There is also a new <a
href="http://linux.birodalom.net/gobophpbb/">forum for Hungarian
users</a>: everyone is welcome!
