The first release candidate for GoboLinux 014 is out! Among other things, it includes a massive update of packages, including Glibc 2.5, Xorg 7.2, GCC 4.1.2 and KDE 3.5.6, with Linux 2.6.20.4 + UTF-8 support. We have now, also, a better printing support, with a few basic drivers included in the LiveCD. And there were many, many bug fixes in the
GoboLinux tools since 013, so we hope to provide a better experience for you all. <a href="http://lists.gobolinux.org/pipermail/gobolinux-users/2007-April/005101.html">Click here</a> for information on download instructions and for the full package list.
