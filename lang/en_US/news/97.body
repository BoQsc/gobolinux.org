Fabio Mierlo <a href="http://lists.gobolinux.org/pipermail/gobolinux-devel/2010-April/004207.html">announced today</a> a new project called <a href="http://stackedboxes.org/~fmierlo/Projects/GoboWing/">GoboWing</a>. It is a port of the GoboLinux tools to Cygwin, allowing them to be used on top of Windows. It is currently based on Rootless and aims to become a full Gobo-ified Cygwin distro. The first public release is <a href="http://stackedboxes.org/~fmierlo/Projects/GoboWing/GoboWing-0.0.4.tar.bz2">GoboWing 0.0.4</a> and it is now available -- the <a href="http://stackedboxes.org/~fmierlo/Projects/GoboWing/Install.txt">installation instructions</a> guide you through the installation of Cygwin and the application of the GoboWing modifications.
