A week after the previous release candidate, GoboLinux 013rc2 is available for <a href="?page=downloads">download</a>. Fixes were performed at a small set of packages, specially Firefox, Pinfo, TeTeX and Udev. Bug reports are welcome at our <a href="http://bugs.gobolinux.org">bug tracker</a>. If no show-stopping bugs are found, we plan to mark this release as final by Thursday.
