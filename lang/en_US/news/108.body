After a long downtime, the GoboLinux wiki is back!

As part of our move to the <a href="http://github.com/gobolinux/">GitHub 
infrastructure</a>, we have imported the contents of the old MediaWiki installation into 
the wiki feature of GitHub. The material is now available (and editable!) at <a 
href="http://github.com/gobolinux/Documentation/wiki">the wiki for the Documentation 
repository</a>.

While there is plenty of useful stuff there, there is also lots of material that are 
currently outdated. Help cleaning it up is most welcome â€” it's a wiki, <a 
href="http://wiki.gobolinux.org">so join in</a>!
