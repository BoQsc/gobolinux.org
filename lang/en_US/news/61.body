<p> 
Fixing issues regarding installation on SCSI hard disks, a third release candidate for 
GoboLinux 013 is <a href="http://gobolinux.org/index.php?page=downloads">available</a>. 
Small fixes were also performed at some management scripts. This is hopefully our last 
release candidate, so we would really like everyone to help us testing it and report any 
problems.

This release is going to be marked as final on November 2nd, if no critical bug is 
found.
