The GoboLinux team is distributing 4000 GoboLinux 014.01 CDs for free at the 9th International Forum on Free Software (<a href="http://fisl.softwarelivre.org">FISL 9.0</a>) in Porto Alegre, Brazil. It's a great opportunity to spread the word about the distro and talk to a lot of people about the project. We hope to post pictures from the event soon!

Last but not least important, we'd like to thank <a href="http://www.unilasalle.edu.br">UniLaSalle</a> for the sponsorship that made this possible.
