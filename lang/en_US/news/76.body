The GoboLinux website now has a new online search tool for recipes: <a href="http://recipes.gobolinux.org">recipes.gobolinux.org</a>, which you can also access from the "chef hat" icon on this page. It has many nice features such as search by descriptions, crosslinked dependencies and the ability to view files from recipes. Many thanks to mpb, who is the developer and maintainer.
