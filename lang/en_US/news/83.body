Announcing a new language available in the GoboLinux website is always fun. We're happy to present <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/?lang=it_IT">gobolinux.org in Italian</a>! Many thanks to Giambattista Bloisi and Daniele Maccari for the initiative and the hard work in translating the site.

As a side note, now the languages of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup#Winners_and_finalists">World Cup</a> winners are available in gobolinux.org. ;-)
