After a long hiatus, we are happy to announce that we are working towards a new release of 
GoboLinux. An alpha version of GoboLinux 015 has been released Today and users are welcome 
to try it and report their experience with the LiveDVD to let us further improve it. The 
announcement (which includes links to download the ISO) can be seen <a
