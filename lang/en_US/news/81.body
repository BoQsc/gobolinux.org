Last week Hisham Muhammad gave a talk at <a href="http://www.latinoware.org">Latinoware 2007</a>, the IV Latin-American Conference on Free Software, which took place at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itaipu">Itaipu</a>, the largest hydroelectric power plant in the world. The slides for the talk (in Portuguese) are available at the <a href="?page=documentation">documentation</a> page, in ODF and PDF formats.

We would also like to thank Frank Alc√¢ntara and the Latinoware organizing team for the invitation and the excellent event!
