<p>
After general enhancements and overall fixes based on reported problems, this release will be the last before a release candidate (to be prepared in the next week). Some programs like OpenOffice were added since 012 alpha1, and the <a href="http://lists.gobolinux.org/pipermail/gobolinux-users/2005-February/000671.html">list of packages</a> will probably be kept until 012 final.
